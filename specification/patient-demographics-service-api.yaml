  title: Personal Demographics Service (FHIR) API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics) - the national electronic database of NHS patient details such as name, address, date of birth and NHS Number.

    You can:
    * search for patients
    * get patient details
    * update patient details

    You cannot currently use this API to:
    * check that you have the right NHS Number for a patient
    * create a new record for a birth
    * receive birth notifications
    * create a record for a new patient
    * register a new patient at a GP Practice - instead, use [National Health Application and Infrastructure Services (NHAIS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhais/nhais-developer-document-library)

    You can access the following data:
    * NHS Number
    * name
    * gender
    * addresses and contact details
    * birth information
    * death information
    * registered GP
    * nominated pharmacy (other related pharmacies coming soon)
    * consent information (coming soon)
    * related people (coming soon)

    Currently, this API can only be accessed by healthcare professionals, authenticated with an NHS smartcard or equivalent.
    Unauthenticated access and citizen access are on the roadmap.

    ## Related APIs
    The following APIs also give access to the Personal Demographics Service:
    - [Personal Demographics Service (SMSP) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-specifications/personal-demographics-service---smsp-api) - use this if you want to get PDS data without an authenticated end used (no smartcard required). It is, however, read-only and searches are limited to a single result.
    - [Personal Demographics Service (HL7 V3) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-specifications/personal-demographics-service-hl7-v3) - use this if you want to use functions that are not yet available on the FHIR API.

    Once our roadmap is complete, the above APIs will become redundant.

    The following APIs are also related to this API:
    - [Organisation Data Service FHIR API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/) - use this to get full details for the organisations related to the patient, such as their registered GP or nominated pharmacy.

    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/reference-guide#api-status) - expect significant breaking changes.

    It is currently only available for sandbox testing, not for integration testing or production use.

    The following items are on our roadmap, in rough priority order:
    - addition of data fields for consent information, related people and more information on nominated pharmacies
    - integration testing service (target date: end of February 2020)
    - onboarding process
    - production service - beta - search for patient and retrieve patient details (target date: end of March 2020)
    - production service - beta - update patient (target date: end of April 2020)
    - unauthenticated access - without NHS smartcard - similar to the PDS SMSP API (target date to be confirmed)
    - access for citizens using NHS Login (target date to be confirmed)
    - exit beta (target date: end of September 2020, subject to availability of beta testers)

    We are extremely keen to receive feedback on the API during alpha and beta,
    for example if there are data fields missing that you think you need.
    Please [get in touch](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support) with any comments or suggestions.

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/introduction-to-apis#basic-rest).

    It also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/introduction-to-apis#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.
    Specifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.

    You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example the `/Patient` not `/patients`
    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    This API is available on the Internet, although access using NHS smartcards (see below)
    currently requires a connection to the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    ## Authorisation
    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
    meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.

    The end user must be:
    - a healthcare professional
    - strongly authenticated, using either an NHS smartcard or a modern alternative

    The API uses Open ID Connect to authenticate the end user and OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling system.
    It supports the following security patterns:
    * user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS Identity - combined authentication and authorisation
    * user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS Identity - separate authentication and authorisation

    For more details, see [user-restricted APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis).

    In due course we plan to add the following:
    - access for citizens, using NHS Login
    - unattended access - without smartcard - similar to the PDS SMSP API

    ## Testing
    You can test this API in:
    * our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/testing#sandbox-testing) for initial developer testing
    * our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/testing#integration-testing) for formal integration testing (coming soon)

    Our sandbox environment is a very basic simulation of the live service. It only covers a limited set of scenarios and is stateless, so does not actually persist any updates.

    For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:

    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/2871d49488699f3f5a67)

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to search for a patient in PDS.

        You can search using a combination of:
          * given name
          * family name
          * gender
          * postcode
          * date of birth (range)
          * date of death (range)
          * registered GP practice

        ## Matching rules
        Search parameters are not case sensitive.

        Spaces in postcodes do not need to match exactly, for example `LS116AD` will match `LS11 6AD`, however including spaces will also work.

        For date of birth and date of death, you can search for an exact date or for a range of dates.

        You can use wildcards in given name and family name. Wildcards must start with at least two characters; for example, `Br*` is valid, but `*cDougal` is not. Multiple wildcards are allowed; for example, `Br*w*` will match `Brown` and `Brower`.
        Be sure that any wildcards are encoded before sending the request. An encoded wildcard is `%2A`; for example, `Br%2A` is valid.

        You can request a fuzzy search using the `_fuzzy-match` queryparameter. This will additionally:
          * match common homophones, such as `Smith` and `Smythe`, using the [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) algorithm
          * check for transposed names, such as `Adam Thomas` and `Thomas Adam`

        ## Search parameter options
        For a non-fuzzy search, the minimum set of search parameters is:
        * family name - but it can include wildcards
        * gender
        * date of birth - but it can be a range

        For a fuzzy search, use one of the following search parameter combinations:
        * given name, family name and date of birth
        * family name, date of birth, gender and postcode
        * given name date of birth, gender and postcode

        If you include the date of death or registered GP Practice query parameters for a fuzzy search, they will not be used as part of the search. However they will affect the patient's matching score, meaning a mismatch will reduce the returned score.

        If you use an invalid combination of query parameters, you will get an `INVALID_COMBINATION` error.

        ## Historic data search
        By default the endpoint only searches current information. You can search historic information, such as previous names or addresses using the `_history` query parameter.

        ## Scoring
        Every matched patient in the results list includes a score to indicate how closely the patient matched the search parameters.

        A score of 1.0 indicates an exact match. A score of less than 1.0 indicates a partial match.

        The result list is sorted in descending score order - best match first.

        Use the `_exact-match` query parameter to return exact matches only - where the score = 1.0.

        ## Number of results returned
        By default, the endpoint will return a maximum of 50 results.

        If there are more than 50 matching patients, the endpoint will return no results and the error response `TOO_MANY_MATCHES`. You can choose to limit the number of results returned using the `_max-results` query parameter.
        You can request a single, exact match using `_exact-match=true` and `_max-results=1`.

        ## Clinical safety and privacy
        This endpoint can return multiple matching patients for a given search, including partial matches.

        You should ensure that you design, build and test your software to minimise these risks:
        * an end user selects the wrong patient from the results presented, so there is a risk of clinical harm; for example due to retrieval of the wrong medical data
        * the end user has access to patients’ personal data, so there is a risk to patient privacy

        ## Sandbox testing
        You can test the following scenarios in our [sandbox environment](/testing#sandbox-testing):

        | Scenario                    | Request                                                      | Response                                   |
        | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
        | Basic search                | `family`=`Smith`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |
        | Wildcard search             | `family`=`Sm*`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22` | HTTP Status 200 with search result of two. |
        | Search with limited results | `family`=`Sm*`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22`, `_max-results`=`2` | HTTP Status 200 with search result of two. |
        | Search with date range      | `family`=`Smith`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`ge2010-10-21`, `birthdate`=`le2010-10-23` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |
        | Fuzzy search                | `family`=`Smith`, `given`=`Jane` `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22`, `_fuzzy-match`=`true` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |
        | Unsuccessful search         | Any other valid search query parameters                      | HTTP Status 200 with no search results     |
        | Invalid date format         | `birthdate` or `death-date` query parameters with values not in format `YYYY-MM-DD` | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |
        | Too few search parameters   | Any invalid combination of query parameters                  | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |

    patch:
      description: |
        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to update patient details in PDS.

        This is a 'patch' operation, meaning you can update specific parts of the patient record (such as a name or an address), as opposed to having to update the entire record.

        ## Patient record versioning
        To update a patient's record you must have retrieved it first.
        When you retrieve a patient record, you get a version number for the record (in the `ETag` header and in the `versionId` field in the response).
        You must then pass the record's version number in the update request (in the `If-Match` header).
        The update will only succeed if the patient record has not been updated in our database in the meantime.
        If the update succeeds, you will receive a copy of the update record in the response, including the new record version number.
        If you have a subsequent update you must use the new version number.

        ## Sandbox test scenarios
        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment.
        Note that your changes will not be persisted.
        JSON Patch operations themselves are validated, but the resulting resource is not validated for correctness.

        | Scenario                            | Request                                                      | Response                                         |
        | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |

        | Invalid NHS Number                  | `id`=`9000000000` (or any invalid NHS Number)        | HTTP Status 400 with problem description         |
        | Missing resource version identifier | `If-Match` header missing or set to format other than `W/"<version>"` | HTTP Status 400 with problem description         |
        | Incorrect resource version          | `If-Match`=`W/"1"`                                           | HTTP Status 412 with problem description         |
        | Wrong content type                  | `Content-Type` header missing or other than `application/json-patch+json` | HTTP Status 415 with problem description         |
        | No patches sent                     | Send body with no `patches` attribute                        | HTTP Status 400 with problem description         |
        | Invalid patch operation(s)          | Send body with invalid JSON patches in `patches` attribute   | HTTP Status 400 with problem description         |
