      Purpose of this address:
        * `home` - the home address is the patient's normal residence. Home address is also known as usual, main, registered, current or permanent address
        * `temp` - a temporary address is an address used for a set period of time, but where the patient's home, permanent address remains unchanged
        * `billing` - an address used for correspondence purposes only
        * `work` - an office address. This can be returned due to legacy data but cannot be added or replaced on update

        A patient should have no more than one current `temp` and/or `billing` address.
        However, historically this was constrained only by the integration requirements and was not enforced so theoretically more than one can exist for a patient when retrieving.
        Where multiple instances already exist for the patient it is not expected that local systems should manage those, but should choose the most appropriate one to maintain (e.g. by examining period dates).

        A `home` address is the patient's main residential address and should normally be used for all clinical and demographic purposes, including clinical and appointment correspondence.
        However additionally, `temp` and `billing` addresses may be provided by a patient when there is a requirement to record an alternative location for the purposes of unbroken care.
        When sending correspondence to a patient:
        *	a present and valid `billing` address may take precedence over `home` and `temp` addresses. A patient should have only a single current `billing` address. An address is considered 'valid' according to its period start and end dates.
        *	if no current `billing` address is provided, a `temp` address may take precedence over the `home` address, again if it is valid according to its period start and end dates.
        * if there is no valid, current `billing` and/or `temp` address, the `home` address must be used.

      Where a `temp` address is provided a descriptor text must be sent.
      The list of possible values are:
      * `Second Home` - a patient's second home
      * `Student Accommodation` - a patient's place of residence while at university
      * `Respite Care Address` - where the patient resides during respite care
      * `Temporary Residence Address` - where the patient resides for a specific period of time
      * `Convalescence Home` - the address for a patient during a period of recovery
      * `Mobile Home` - the address of a patient's mobile home, parked for a specific period of time, e.g. the address of a caravan park
      * `Holiday Home` - the address for a patient during a holiday
      
      A patient can also register temporarily at a GP practice using a temporary address. Temporary GP registration information does not appear on the PDS, but the address used for it may.
