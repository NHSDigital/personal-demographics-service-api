      The level of security on the patients record, which affects which fields are populated on retrieval. The possible responses are:
      * U - unrestricted. All available data is returned.
      * R - restricted. Any sensitive data around the patient's location, so `address`, `generalPractitioner` and `telecom`, are removed from the response.
      * V - very restricted. All patient data is removed from the response apart from `id`, `identifier` and `meta` fields. The `gender` field returns `unknown` regardless of actual gender.
      * REDACTED - redacted. The patient record has been marked as invalid, so the data should not be used. This code is never returned; you receive a 404, and appropriate error response, if an invalidated patient retrieval is attempted.
