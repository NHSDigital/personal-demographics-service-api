            Symbol, in syntax, defined by the system:
            * `1` - Informal - death notice received via an update from a local NHS Organisation such as GP or Trust
            * `2` - Formal - death notice received from Registrar of Deaths. Only these endpoints are allowed to add a Formal death:
                - National Back Office using the Demographic Spine Application (DSA)
                - Office of National Statistics (ONS)
                - Maternity sites
            * `U` - Removed. This is a possible response, but it cannot be used on an update because Spine will reject it
          example: '2'
          enum: ['1', '2', 'U']
