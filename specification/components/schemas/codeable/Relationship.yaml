      Coded values for three relationship types:
      * Role
      * Type
      * Next-of-Kin

      The codes used can be found at:
      * http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/relatedperson-relationshiptype
      * INVALID URL - https://fhir.nhs.uk/R4/CodeSystem/UKCore-AdditionalRelatedPersonRole

      The allowed values for `Role` are:
      * Agent - Agent of patient
      * Guardian - Guardian of patient
      * Personal - Personal relationship with the patient

      The allowed values for `Type` are:
      * SPS - spouse
      * DOMPART - domestic partner
      * PRN - parent
      * PRNFOST - foster parent
      * STPPRN - step parent
      * CHILD - child
      * MTH - mother
      * FTH - father
      * SIS - sister
      * BRO - brother
      * FAMMEMB - family member
      * ONESELF - self
      * N - Next-of-Kin
      * U - Unknown
      * PolygamousPartner - Polygamous Partner of patient
      * Dependant - Dependant of patient
      * NonDependant - Non Dependant of patient
      * ProxyContact - Proxy Contact for patient
      * ProxyCommunication - Proxy Communication for patient
      * ProxyContactCommunication - Proxy Contact and Communication for patient
      * Carer - Carer of patient
      * Guardian - Guardian of patient
      * NotSpecified - Not Specified

      The allowed values for `Next-of-Kin` are:
      * N - Next-of-Kin

      `Role` and `Type` are mandatory, so both should be present - however they both contain the `Guardian` code - so a single response is possible.

      `Next-of-Kin` is optional and will be absent from the response when the related person is not the Next-of-Kin.
