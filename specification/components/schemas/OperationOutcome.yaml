  Outcome of an operation that does not result in a resource or bundle being returned (e.g. error, async/batch submission).
  There are a number of possible error codes that can be returned along with a more detailed description in the `display` field.

  There are general outcomes:
  | Code                       | Response Code | Description                                   |
  | -------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
  | ACCESS_DENIED              | 401           | Used when the user does not have permission for a particular request. eg. when their asid does not have the correct interactions attached to it. |
  | FAILURE_TO_PROCESS_MESSAGE | 500           | A default message when something really bad has happened that the system could not handle.	|
  | UNABLE_TO_CALL_SERVICE     | 408           | For a synchronous request, the downstream domain processing has not completed within the configured timeout period. |
  | UNSUPPORTED_SERVICE        | 400           | The service the user requested an endpoint that does not exist - so is unsupported. eg. /Patient/9999999999/Pets |
  | RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND         | 404           | The resource was not found. |
  | INVALID_RESOURCE_ID        | 400           | The resource id was not valid. For example a NHS Number is presented which is not a valid NHS Number. |
  | INVALIDATED_RESOURCE       | 404           | The resource has been invalidated so could not be returned. |

  Search outcomes:
  | Code                       | Response Code | Description                                   |
  | -------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
  | INVALID_SEARCH_DATA	       | 400           | The search parameters are invalid. A description of what exactly is at fault will be added to the display. |
  | TOO_MANY_MATCHES           | 200           | Too many matches were found - user should be told to refine their search parameters.	|

  Update outcomes:
  | Code                       | Response Code | Description                                   |
  | -------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
  | PRECONDITION_FAILED        | 412           | Request missing basic requirements such as If-Match header (or invalid headers). |
  | RESOURCE_VERSION_MISMATCH  | 409           | The resource version has changed since your last read, so the update has been rejected. |
  | FORBIDDEN_UPDATE           | 403           | The user is not permitted to update certain resources or elements - a detailed description will be added to the display. For example - updating a sensitive patient or adding a formal death notification is only permitted from certain systems. |
  | VALIDATION_ERROR           | 400           | This it the "default" error thrown when no others are applicable. |
  | INVALID_UPDATE             | 400           | The update was invalid - a detailed description will be added to the display. |
  | MISSING_VALUE              | 400           | There was a missing value in the request. For example - a name update that is missing the surname. The missing value will be presented in the display.	|
  | INVALID_VALUE              | 400           | There was an invalid value in the request. For example - a name update where the surname is too long. The invalid value and field will be presented in the display. |
  | UNSUPPORTED_VALUE          | 400           | There was an unsupported value in the request. The value may be valid in the schmema - however it could be a legacy value that we do not allow to be set anymore. For example - setting the death notification status to 'removed'. The invalid value and field will be presented in the display. |
  | TOO_FEW_VALUES_SUBMITTED   | 400           | The field in question has a minimum number of items and the user sent too few. |
  | TOO_MANY_VALUES_SUBMITTED  | 400           | The field in question has a maximum number of items and the user sent too many. |
  | ADDITIONAL_PROPERTIES      | 400           | The user sent additional properties within the dictionary. For example sending a patient patch and attempting to add 'pets', which is not an allowed field within the patient resource. |

  Polling outcomes
  | Code                       | Response Code | Description                                   |
  | -------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
  | POLLING_ID_NOT_FOUND       | 404           | When polling the id was not found - or it was not applicable such as a non polling id.	|
  | POLLING_MESSAGE_FAILURE    | 422           | When polling an id, a message was found to be in a failed state, so there is nothing else to be done and should be considered a failure. |
