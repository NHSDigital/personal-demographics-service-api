  Corresponds to `meta.versionId` attribute in the patient resource body.
  When you retrieve a patient resource, you get a version number for the resource (in the `ETag` response header and in the `versionId` field in the response).
  You must then pass the resource's version number in any update request (in the `If-Match` response header) made for the patient.
