summary: Get a patients coverage
operationId: get-coverage
description: |
  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to get a patient's European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) details. Use the patient's NHS number as the identifier for coverage.

  This endpoint only gives EHIC data in the coverage data fields. A patient may have other financial coverage, like insurance, but this information will not be returned by PDS. 

  You can only use this endpoint if you are using patient access mode (for specific use cases only). 

  If EHIC details are stored on PDS but the personal ID or institution ID are missing then the entire EHIC record will not be returned. 
    
  ## Superseded patients
  Some patients are marked as superseded. This means that the original patient NHS number is no longer valid and has been replaced with a different NHS number.

  When PDS tries to get the EHIC details using the NHS number of a superseded record, it will return the EHIC details of the retained record. This can be seen by comparing the returned NHS number with the NHS number submitted in the request.

  ## Sandbox test scenarios
    You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

    | Scenario                                      | Request                                       | Response                                                     |
    | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Coverage details exist for the patient        | `id`=`9000000009`                             | HTTP Status 200 with patient coverage details in response    |
    | Coverage details do not exist for the patient | `id`=`9000000033`                             | HTTP Status 200 with no patient coverage details in response |
    | Invalid Search criteria                       | `id`=`9999999990`, `year`=`2003`              | HTTP Status 400 with problem description                     |
    | Missing X-Request-ID                          | `id`=`9000000009`                             | HTTP Status 400 with problem description                     |
    | Invalid X-Request-ID                          | X-Request-ID = 1234                           | HTTP Status 400 with problem description                     |
