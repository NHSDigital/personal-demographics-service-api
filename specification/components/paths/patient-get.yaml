  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to get patient details from PDS for a given NHS number.
  
  You cannot get a patient's related people details, use the RelatedPerson endpoint instead.

  ## Superseded patients
  Some patients are marked as superseded. This means that the original patient details are no longer valid and have been replaced with different details.

  On retrieval of a superseded patient's details, the new details are automatically returned in place of the requested details. You can spot a superseded patient when the `id` is not the same as the one requested.

  When retrieving superseding patient details you must update your system with the new patient details and remove the superseded patient details, ensuring that the same `id` does not exist against another patient in your system.

  ## Restricted patients
  Some patients are tagged as [restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/restricting-access-to-a-patients-demographic-record) and are sometimes known as sensitive patients. Restricted patients can be retrieved; however, location-sensitive fields such as `address`, `telecom` and `generalPractitioner` are removed.

  The restricted flag can be found in the data under `meta/security` on the patient resource.

  ## Sandbox test scenarios
  You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

  | Scenario                         | Request                                           | Response                                                                                                                                      |

  | Patient exists                   | `id`=`9000000009`                                 | HTTP Status 200 with patient data in response                                                                                                 |
  | Sensitive patient exists         | `id`=`9000000025`                                 | HTTP Status 200 with patient data in response with the restricted data removed                                                                |
  | Patient exists with minimal data | `id`=`9000000033`                                 | HTTP Status 200 with patient data in response, there will be very little data so can be used as an example of a patient with bad data quality |
  | Patient does not exist           | `id`=`9111231130` (or any other valid NHS number) | HTTP Status 404 with problem description                                                                                                      |
  | Invalid NHS number               | `id`=`9000000000` (or any invalid NHS number)     | HTTP Status 400 with problem description                                                                                                      |
  | Missing X-Request-ID             | `id`=`9000000009` (or any other valid NHS number) | HTTP Status 400 with problem description                                                                                                      |
