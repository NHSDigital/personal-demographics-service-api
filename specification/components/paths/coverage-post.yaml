summary: Update a patient's coverage
operationId: post-coverage
description: |
  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to update a patient's European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) details. A patient may have other financial coverage, like insurance, but this information cannot be added to PDS.  

  There can only be one set of EHIC details on a patient's record at a time. If a patient already has an EHIC record in PDS, the update request will replace the existing EHIC record. When a user adds a new EHIC record to PDS, they must enter information for all the EHIC data fields.  

  You can only update EHIC details using patient access mode (for specific use cases only). 

  ## Patient resource versioning
  To update a patient's details, use the `get a patient's coverage` operation to get a version number for the most up-to-date details. The version number is in the `ETag` response header in the form `W/"2"`.

  You must then pass the patient's version number in the update request, in the `If-Match` response header. If the coverage details have been updated in PDS between your first retrieval and the update request, the update will fail.

  When the update succeeds, you will get the updated coverage details. This will contain the new resource version number.

  If you make a further update you must use the new version number.

  ## Sandbox test scenarios

  You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment.
