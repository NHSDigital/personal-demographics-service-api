    summary: Get a patient's coverage
    operationId: get-coverage
    description: |
      ## Overview
      Use this endpoint to get a patient's European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) details. Use the patient's NHS number as the identifier for coverage.

      This endpoint only gives EHIC data in the coverage data fields. A patient may have other financial coverage, like insurance, but this information will not be returned by PDS. 

      You can only use this endpoint if you are using patient access mode (for specific use cases only). 

      If EHIC details are stored on PDS but the personal ID or institution ID are missing then the entire EHIC record will not be returned. 
        
      ## Superseded patients
      Some patients are marked as superseded. This means that the original patient NHS number is no longer valid and has been replaced with a different NHS number.

      When PDS tries to get the EHIC details using the NHS number of a superseded record, it will return the EHIC details of the retained record. This can be seen by comparing the returned NHS number with the NHS number submitted in the request.

    summary: Update a patient's coverage
    operationId: post-coverage
    description: |
      ## Overview
      Use this endpoint to update a patient's European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) details. A patient may have other financial coverage, like insurance, but this information cannot be added to PDS.  

      There can only be one set of EHIC details on a patient's record at a time. If a patient already has an EHIC record in PDS, the update request will replace the existing EHIC record. When a user adds a new EHIC record to PDS, they must enter information for all the EHIC data fields.  
    
      You can only update EHIC details using patient access mode (for specific use cases only). 

      ## Patient resource versioning
      To update a patient's details, use the `get a patient's coverage` operation to get a version number for the most up-to-date details. The version number is in the `ETag` response header in the form `W/"2"`.

      You must then pass the patient's version number in the update request, in the `If-Match` response header. If the coverage details have been updated in PDS between your first retrieval and the update request, the update will fail.

      When the update succeeds, you will get the updated coverage details. This will contain the new resource version number.

      If you make a further update you must use the new version number.
