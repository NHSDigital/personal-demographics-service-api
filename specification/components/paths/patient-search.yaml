summary: Search for a patient
operationId: search-patient

  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to search for a patient in PDS.
  
  You can search using various combinations of:
    * given name
    * family name
    * gender
    * postcode
    * date of birth - which can be a range
    * date of death - which can be a range
    * registered GP practice
    * email address
    * phone number
    
  There are various search options, such as fuzzy search, exact match, history and wildcards. Wildcard searches using the PDS FHIR API return information differently to the FHIR framework standards. 
  
  The behaviour of this endpoint depends on which access mode you are using:
  
  | Access mode                    | Behaviour                                  |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
  | Application-restricted access  | Only a single unique match returned        |
  | Healthcare worker access       | Up to 50 matching patient records returned |
  | Patient access                 | Not yet available                          |

  

  ## Patient data returned
  The patient data returned on a search is not the full set of data that is returned on a retrieval by NHS number. The following data is included:
  * NHS number
  * names - usual, nickname and temporary
  * gender
  * birth information, apart from place of birth
  * death information
  * address - home address
  * contact details
  * registered GP
  * restricted patient flag

  The following data is excluded:
  * place of birth
  * names, apart from usual, nickname and temporary 
  * addresses, apart from home address
  * pharmacy details
  * communication details
  * contact preferences

  ### Restricted patients
  Some patients are tagged as [restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/restricting-access-to-a-patients-demographic-record) and are sometimes known as sensitive patients. When performing a search, restricted patients can be returned; however, location sensitive fields such as `address`, `telecom`, `contact` and `generalPractitioner` are removed.

  If `address-postalcode`, `address-postcode`, or `general-practitioner` are included in the search parameters, no restricted patients are returned even if a match is identified.

  The restricted flag can be found in the data under `meta/security` on the patient resource.
  
  ### Invalidated patients
  Some patients are marked as invalidated in PDS - also known as `redacted` in FHIR terminology. Invalidated patient records are not returned in search results.
  If an invalidated patient record has been superseded, the superseding record is returned.

  ## Scoring
  Every matched patient in the result list includes a score to indicate how closely the patient matched the search parameters.

  A score of 1.0 indicates an exact match. A score of less than 1.0 indicates a partial match.

  The result list is sorted in descending score order - best match first.

  Use the `_exact-match` query parameter to return exact matches only - where the score is 1.0.

  ## Clinical safety and privacy
  This endpoint can return multiple matching patients for a given search, including partial matches.

  Ensure that you design your software to minimise the following risks:
  * an end user selects the wrong patient from the results presented, so there is a risk of clinical harm; for example due to retrieval of the wrong clinical data
  * the end user has access to patients’ personal data, so there is a risk to patient privacy

  Note that:
  * we record an access request in our audit trail for all patients matched in a PDS search
  * it is almost certainly a good idea to display search results in descending score order - best match first

  Please consider the information your application returns to users. For example a patient's temporary address can be used to perform a successful search. The home address will be included in the response. For citizen facing services please be aware of this behaviour and do not present a different address to the patient, unless they are logged in at a sufficiently high proof point.
  
  ## Search options
  The following sections explain the various search options.
  Which options you choose depends very much on your use case, and getting it right is really important.
  If you need help, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

  ### Application-restricted access mode
  In this access mode, you only get a single matching patient record, and only if it's a unique match.

  Use search options that are likely to find a unique match. In our experience, the following is a good starting point:
    * search on given name, family name, postcode and date of birth - this combination should uniquely identify a patient
    * for given name, use the first three characters and a wildcard, for example to search for `Annabel`, use `Ann*` - this caters for different name spellings and abbreviations
    * for postcode, use the first two characters and a wildcard, for example to search for `LS11 6AD`, use `LS*` - this caters for people who have moved locally but not updated PDS
    * use a non-fuzzy search - this reduces the chance of multiple matches
    * use a non-exact match - an exact match does not work with wildcards
    * include history - this increases the chance of a match

  For more details, see the following sections.

  ### Healthcare worker access mode
  In this access mode - where the end user is a strongly authenticated healthcare worker - you can get up to 50 matching patient records.
  This allows the end user to choose the best match.

  Use search parameters that are relevant to your use case - for example date of death is not always appropriate.
  
  To protect patient privacy, design your search to minimise the number of matching patients.
  For example, you could:
    * encourage users to enter as many search parameters as they can
    * force users to try a non-fuzzy search first and then only offer a fuzzy search if they cannot find the patient
  
  For more details, see the following sections.

  ### Non-fuzzy search
  A non-fuzzy search:
    * allows wildcards in names and postcodes
    * does not match homophones or transposed names
    * can optionally search history, such as previous names and addresses

  It is less likely to return multiple matches than a fuzzy search, so is more suitable for finding a unique match.

  The minimum search parameters are:
    * family name - which can include wildcards
    * date of birth - which can be a range
    
  ### Fuzzy search
  A fuzzy search:
    * matches common homophones, such as `Smith` and `Smythe`, using the [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) algorithm
    * checks for transposed names, such as `Adam Thomas` and `Thomas Adam`
    * always searches history, such as previous names and addresses

  It is more likely to include multiple matches than a non-fuzzy search, so is not ideal for finding a unique match.
  
  It is also more likely to include false positives - other patients that match the search criteria.
  Therefore, for privacy reasons, it is better to use it only if a non-fuzzy match has failed.

  You must use one of the following search parameter combinations:
    * given name, family name and date of birth
    * family name, date of birth, gender and postcode
    * given name, date of birth, gender and postcode

  If you include the date of death or registered GP practice query parameters, they are not used in the search. However they do affect the patient's matching score - a mismatch reduces the returned score.

  ### History
  PDS holds historic information, including previous names and addresses.

  A fuzzy search always includes history. For a non-fuzzy search, you can request to include history.

  Searching history can match patients when only a previous name or address is known, or if a patient provides a previous name or address on the assumption that their record hasn’t been updated. When a search done on historic data results in a match, the patient's current data will be returned in the response message, not the historic data used to identify the match.

  ### Exact match
  You can request an exact match.
  This might be useful if you are verifying an NHS number against details you already believe to be correct.
  It is unlikely to work well with wildcards or fuzzy search.

  ### Names
  Matching names can be difficult when a person has multiple given names, including:
    * given names that include middle names, such as in `Jane Anne Smith`
    * [compound given names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#Compound), such as in `John Paul Smith`

  Matching names can also be difficult when a name has:
    * multiple or double-barrelled surnames, such as in `Michael Smith-Jones`
    * homophones, such as `Smith` and `Smythe` or `Ann` and `Anne`
    * abbreviated names, such as `Bob` instead of `Robert`
    * transposed names, such as `Adam Thomas` instead of `Thomas Adam`
    * previous names, such as maiden names
    * special characters such as in `O'Reilly`, `Jones-Smith` or `Kociński`
    * spelling mistakes, either in the search criteria or in PDS

  To deal with some of these issues:
    * we search across all types of name - usual, nickname and temporary
    * a fuzzy search matches homophones, transposed names and previous names
    * for a non fuzzy search, you can optionally search previous names and use wildcards. Wildcards will match against the start of the name string, for example the start of a compound name.

  ### Gender
  PDS has four options for gender - `male`, `female`, `other` and `unknown`.
  This is the gender that is recorded on official documents, for example a birth certificate or passport. For some people, the gender held in PDS might not match the gender they identify with.

  In these cases, searching by gender might not find the patient.
  These are edge cases but are important to consider because gender can be a sensitive issue for the people in question.

  In general, we recommend not including gender as a search parameter.
    
  ### Date of birth and death
  Sometimes, the exact date of birth or death is not known when doing a search.
  Sometimes, the date of birth or death is not accurate in PDS.
  For example, if only the year of birth is known, the day and month of birth might be recorded as the first of January - for example, `01/01/1932`.

  In such cases, searching a range of dates can help. This can result in multiple matches, so might not work well when searching for a unique match.

  ### Postcode
  People sometimes move locally, meaning the postcode in PDS is out of date, but does at least match on the first two characters.

  Searching for the first two characters of the postcode and a wildcard can work well. For example, to search for `LS11 6AD`, use `LS*`.
  This is only possible for a non-fuzzy search.
  
  This can result in multiple matches, but it has been known to work well in some cases - even for unique matches.

  ### General practitioner
  This is an ODS code. If you use it, it must match exactly.

  ### Phone number and email address
  If you use phone number and/or email address, only exact matches will be returned.
    * Wildcards are not supported
    * Only current data will be searched, unless a history search is also requested in which case the match will take into account both current and historic data
    * Email addresses are not case-sensitive.
