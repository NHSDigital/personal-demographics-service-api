  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to get a patient's related people details from PDS for a given NHS number. This is a list of people who can be contacted, and how, regarding the patient. These details may be useful for a practitioner to get in contact with a next of kin or guardian.
  
  ## Restricted patients
  Some patients are tagged as [restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/restricting-access-to-a-patients-demographic-record) and are sometimes known as sensitive patients. Related people are not returned for a restricted patient and an empty bundle is returned.

  If a related person only contains a patient reference, and when the patient is retrieved, it is restricted; location sensitive fields such as `address` and `telecom` are removed.

  ## Sandbox test scenarios
  You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

  | Scenario                        | Request                                       | Response                                                      |
  | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Multiple related people exists  | `id`=`9000000009`                             | HTTP Status 200 with related person data in a response Bundle |
  | Single related person exists    | `id`=`9000000017`                             | HTTP Status 200 with related person data in a response Bundle |
  | Related people do not exist     | `id`=`9000000025`                             | HTTP Status 200 with an empty bundle                          |
  | Missing X-Request-ID            | `id`=`9000000009` (or any other valid NHS number) | HTTP Status 400 with problem description                  |
