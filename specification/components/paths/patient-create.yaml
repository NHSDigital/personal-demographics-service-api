  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to request an NHS number. Only use this if a search for the patient has been done and no NHS number can be found.

  You should not use this API to create a new record when registering a new patient at a GP Practice. Instead, use the Primary Care Registration Management - NHS Digital (PCRM) system.

  This endpoint is only available to users with Healthcare worker access.                                                                                                              | HTTP Status 400 with problem description.                                                 |
