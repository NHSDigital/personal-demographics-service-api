  title: Personal Demographics Service (FHIR) API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics) - the national electronic database of NHS patient details such as name, address, date of birth, related people and NHS Number.

    You can:
    * search for patients
    * get patient details
    * update patient details

    You cannot currently use this API to:
    * check that you have the right NHS Number for a patient (but you can achieve this indirectly using search for patient or get patient details)
    * create a new record for a birth
    * receive birth notifications
    * create a record for a new patient
    * register a new patient at a GP Practice - instead, use [NHAIS GP Links API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhais-gp-links)

    You can read and update the following data:
    * NHS Number (read only)
    * name
    * gender
    * addresses and contact details
    * birth information
    * death information
    * registered GP
    * nominated pharmacy
    * dispensing doctor pharmacy
    * medical appliance supplier pharmacy
    * related people, such as next of kin (read only - update coming soon)

    This API has three access modes:
    
    
    | Access mode                    | End user authentication                             | Functions          | Availability |
    | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
    | Healthcare professional access | NHS Identity (NHS smartcard or modern alternative)  | Search for patients (multiple results), Get patient details, Update patient details | Available in production (beta) |
    | Application-restricted access  | None                                                | Search for patients (single result), Get patient details | Available for testing (alpha) 
    | Citizen access                 | NHS login                                           | Get own details, Update own details (limited) | Not available yet, see [backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/107446/pds-fhir-api-citizen-access-using-nhs-login) for details   |

  
    ## Legal use
    This API can only be used where there is a [legal basis](http://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/access-data-on-the-personal-demographics-service) to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.  To do this, make a [PDS access request](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/access-data-on-the-personal-demographics-service). 
    
    You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

    ## Related APIs
    The following APIs also give access to the Personal Demographics Service:
    - [Personal Demographics Service (SMSP) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine/spine-mini-service-provider-for-personal-demographics-service) - use this if you want to get PDS data without an authenticated end user (no smartcard required). It is, however, read-only and searches are limited to a single result.
    - [Personal Demographics Service (HL7 V3) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-hl7-v3) - use this if you want to use functions that are not yet available on the FHIR API.

    Once our roadmap is complete, the above APIs will become redundant.

    The following APIs are also related to this API:
    - [Organisation Data Service FHIR API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/) - use this to get full details for the organisations related to the patient, such as their registered GP or nominated pharmacy.

    ## API status and roadmap
    ### Healthcare professional access
    This access mode is in [beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we can't avoid it, and we'll give advance notice
    - we can't guarantee availability or performance
    
    ### Application-restricted access
    This access mode is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
    - it is available for testing but not yet for production use
    - we might make breaking changes
     
    ### Citizen access
    This access mode is not available yet.
    
    ### Roadmap
    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=allexceptdone&tag=pds-fhir-api).
    
    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).

    It also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.
    Specifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.

    You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Patient` not `/patients`
    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    To use this API with NHS smartcards (see below) you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives are available.
    
    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
    
    ## Security and authorisation
    ### Healthcare professional access
    This access mode is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
    meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.

    The end user must be:
    - a healthcare professional
    - strongly authenticated, using either an NHS smartcard or a modern alternative

    The API uses OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling system.
    
    It supports the following security patterns:
    * [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS Identity - combined authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-identity-combined-authentication-and-authorisation)
    * [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS Identity - separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-identity-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    In this access mode, all endpoints are fully available.
    
    In addition, the end user must be authorised to perform the various activities.
    
    The API itself does not perform any authorisation checks. Rather, the calling application must perform them. The authorisation rules are specified in our national Role Based Access Control (RBAC) database.
    
    For more details, contact us (https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
    
    ### Application-restricted access
    This access mode is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis), meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.
    
    In particular, we use following security pattern:
    * [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)
    
    You can use this access mode as follows:
    * unattended (end user not present), for example as part of a back end process to check NHS numbers for data flowing from one system to another
    * attended (end user present) - in which case, you must ensure the end user is authenticated and suitably authorised locally by the calling application
    
    ### Citizen access
    This access mode is not available yet. 
        
    For more details, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=allexceptdone&tag=pds-fhir-api).

    | Environment       | Base URL                                                       |
    | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Sandbox           | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/personal-demographics/`    |
    | Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/personal-demographics/`        |
    | Production        | `https://api.service.nhs.uk/personal-demographics/`                                              |

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:
    
    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/7ca0d7d9e12a851fd335)

    ### Download Postman client

    If you don’t have it, you can download Postman [here](https://www.postman.com).
    
    Click on the download button in the top right corner and follow the instructions.

    ### Download our collection

    If you already have the Postman client installed - click onto our postman collection (button above) - then click onto the ‘Postman for Windows’ or ‘Postman for Mac’ version - and click Open when prompted.
    
    Postman client should then open showing our Patient Demographics Sandbox.

    If you have already downloaded the Sandbox collection from one of our other endpoints, found under the PDS FHIR API pages, you don't have to download it again as the same collection covers all endpoints.


    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with options for user-restricted access (with or without smartcard) and application-restricted access
         
    For read-only testing, you can either use our [PDS FHIR API test data packs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir/pds-fhir-api-test-data) or set up your own test data.
    
    To test updating patient details, you must set up your own test data.

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.
    
    To onboard for this API, follow the [Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL) process.](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/onboarding-process#onboard-using-the-supplier-conformance-assessment-list-scal-process)

    When following the SCAL process, note that:
    * In step 1: to confirm your use case for this API, you need to [make a PDS access request](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/access-data-on-the-personal-demographics-service), even if you already access PDS via another method.
    * In step 6: when implementing your clinical risk management process, you must review and integrate the PDS FHIR API hazard log into your own risk log. You’ll find it embedded within the PDS FHIR API tab in the SCAL.
    * In step 8: you need to review and complete the PDS FHIR API risk log to show that you have understood and mitigated the various risks. You might be asked to provide some evidence to prove that controls have been put in place. You’ll find the risk log embedded within the PDS FHIR API tab in the SCAL. This is separate from the clinical safety hazard log mentioned above.
    * In step 9: you must conduct penetration testing to [CHECK standards](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/check-penetration-testing).
    * In step 10: when you complete the Service Desk Registration Form, send it to [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).
    * In step 11: submit your completed SCAL to [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).
    * In step 14: to request production access, contact us at [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to search for a patient in PDS.

        You can search using a combination of:
          * given name
          * family name
          * gender
          * postcode
          * date of birth (range)
          * date of death (range)
          * registered GP practice
          
        The behaviour of this endpoint depends on which access mode you are using:
        
        | Access mode                    | Behaviour restrictions            |
        | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
        | Healthcare professional access | Full behaviour available          |
        | Application-restricted access  | Limited to a single unique result |
        | Citizen access                 | Not yet available                 |

        ## Matching rules
        Search parameters are not case sensitive.

        Spaces in postcodes do not need to match exactly, for example `LS116AD` will match `LS11 6AD`, however including spaces will also work.

        For date of birth and date of death, you can search for an exact date or for a range of dates.

        You can use wildcards in given name and family name. Wildcards must start with at least two characters; for example, `Br*` is valid, but `*cDougal` is not. Multiple wildcards are allowed; for example, `Br*w*` will match `Brown` and `Brower`.
        Be sure that any wildcards are encoded before sending the request. An encoded wildcard is `%2A`; for example, `Br%2A` is valid.

        You can request a fuzzy search using the `_fuzzy-match` query parameter. This will:
          * match common homophones, such as `Smith` and `Smythe`, using the [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) algorithm
          * check for transposed names, such as `Adam Thomas` and `Thomas Adam`

        Wildcards cannot be used with a fuzzy search.

        ## Search parameter options
        For a non-fuzzy search (`_fuzzy-match`=`false`), the minimum set of search parameters is:
        * family name - but it can include wildcards
        * gender
        * date of birth - but it can be a range

        For a fuzzy search (`_fuzzy-match`=`true`), use one of the following search parameter combinations:
        * given name, family name and date of birth
        * family name, date of birth, gender and postcode
        * given name, date of birth, gender and postcode

        If you include the date of death or registered GP Practice query parameters for a fuzzy search, they will not be used as part of the search. However they will affect the patient's matching score, meaning a mismatch will reduce the returned score.

        If you use an invalid combination of query parameters, you will get an `INVALID_COMBINATION` error.

        ## Historic data search
        By default the endpoint only searches current information.
        You can search historic information, such as previous names or addresses using the `_history` query parameter.

        You cannot perform a fuzzy search on historic information.

        ## Scoring
        Every matched patient in the result list includes a score to indicate how closely the patient matched the search parameters.

        A score of 1.0 indicates an exact match. A score of less than 1.0 indicates a partial match.

        The result list is sorted in descending score order - best match first.

        Use the `_exact-match` query parameter to return exact matches only - where the score is 1.0.

        ## Restricted patients
        Some patients are tagged as [restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/restricting-access-to-a-patients-demographic-record), or sensitive. When performing a search, restricted patients can be returned; however, location sensitive fields such as `address`, `telecom`, `contact` and `generalPractitioner` will be removed.

        If `address-postcode` or `general-practitioner` are included in the search parameters, no restricted patients will be returned even if a match is identified.

        The restricted flag can be found in the data under `meta/security` on the patient resource.

        ## Number of results returned
        ###Healthcare professional access mode
        
        By default, the endpoint will return a maximum of 50 results.

        If there are more than 50 matching patients, the endpoint will return no results and the error response `TOO_MANY_MATCHES`.
        You can further limit the number of results using the `_max-results` query parameter.
        You can request a single, exact match using `_exact-match=true` and `_max-results=1`.
        
        ###Application-restricted access mode
        
        The endpoint will only return one result. If there is more than one matching patient, the endpoint will return no results and the error response `TOO_MANY_MATCHES`.

        ## Patient data returned
        The patient data returned on a search is not the full set of data that is returned on a retrieval. The following data is included:
        * NHS Number
        * name
        * gender
        * all birth information, apart from place of birth
        * death information
        * home address
        * contact details
        * registered GP
        * restricted patient flag

        The following data is excluded:
        * place of birth
        * all addresses apart from home address
        * pharmacy details
        * communication details
        * contact preferences

        ## Clinical safety and privacy
        This endpoint can return multiple matching patients for a given search, including partial matches.

        You should ensure that you design, build and test your software to minimise these risks:
        * an end user selects the wrong patient from the results presented, so there is a risk of clinical harm; for example due to retrieval of the wrong medical data
        * the end user has access to patients’ personal data, so there is a risk to patient privacy

        In particular, it is almost certainly a good idea to display search results in descending score order - best match first.

        ## Sandbox testing
        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

        | Scenario                    | Request                                                      | Response                                   |
        | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
        | Basic search                | `family`=`Smith`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |
        | Wildcard search             | `family`=`Sm*`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22` | HTTP Status 200 with search result of two. |
        | Search with limited results | `family`=`Sm*`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22`, `_max-results`=`2` | HTTP Status 200 with search result of two. |
        | Search with date range      | `family`=`Smith`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`ge2010-10-21`, `birthdate`=`le2010-10-23` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |
        | Fuzzy search                | `family`=`Smith`, `given`=`Jane` `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22`, `_fuzzy-match`=`true` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |
        | Restricted patient search   | `family`=`Smythe`, `given`=`Janet` `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2005-06-16` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result with restricted data omitted. |
        | Unsuccessful search         | Any other valid search query parameters                      | HTTP Status 200 with no search results     |
        | Invalid date format         | `birthdate` or `death-date` query parameters with values not in format `YYYY-MM-DD` | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |
        | Too few search parameters   | Any invalid combination of query parameters                  | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to get patient details from PDS for a given NHS Number.
        
        You cannot get a patient's related people details, use the RelatedPerson endpoint instead.

        ## Superseded patients
        Some patients are marked as superseded, this means that for some reason the original resource is no longer valid and has been replaced with a different resource.

        On retrieval of a superseded resource the new resource will be automatically returned in place of the requested resource. You will be able to spot a superseded resource when the `id` is not the same as the one requested.

        When retrieving a superseding resource you must update your system with the new resource and remove the superseded resource, ensuring that the same `id` does not exist against another resource in your system.

        ## Restricted patients
        Some patients are tagged as [restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/restricting-access-to-a-patients-demographic-record), or sensitive. Restricted patients can be retrieved; however, location sensitive fields such as `address`, `telecom` and `generalPractitioner` will be removed.

        The restricted flag can be found in the data under `meta/security` on the patient resource.

        ## Sandbox test scenarios
        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

        | Scenario                         | Request                                           | Response                                                                                                                                      |

        | Patient doesn't exist            | `id`=`9111231130` (or any other valid NHS Number) | HTTP Status 404 with problem description                                                                                                      |
        | Invalid NHS Number               | `id`=`9000000000` (or any invalid NHS Number)     | HTTP Status 400 with problem description                                                                                                      |

        You can try out the sandbox using the "Try this API" feature on this page.

        Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:
        
        [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/7ca0d7d9e12a851fd335)
              
        ### Download Postman client

        If you don’t have it, you can download Postman [here](https://www.postman.com).   
    
        Click on the download button in the top right corner and follow the instructions.

        ### Download our collection

        If you already have the Postman client installed - click onto our postman collection (button above) - then click onto the ‘Postman for Windows’ or ‘Postman for Mac’ version - and click Open when prompted.
    
        Postman client should then open showing our Patient Demographics Sandbox.

        If you have already downloaded the Sandbox collection from one of our other endpoints, found under the PDS FHIR API pages, you don't have to download it again as the same collection covers all endpoints.

    patch:
      description: |
        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to update patient details in PDS.

        This is a 'patch' operation - you can update specific parts of the patient record, such as name or gender, without having to update the entire record.

        The update process is asynchronous - if the request is accepted, a 202 response is returned with a polling URL in the `Content-Location` header.
        Poll this URL for the outcome of the update. See the polling endpoint `/_poll/{message id}` for more details.
        
        The behaviour of this endpoint depends on which access mode you are using:
        
        | Access mode                    | Behaviour restrictions              |
        | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
        | Healthcare professional access | Full behaviour available            |
        | Application-restricted access  | Limited to a single unique result   |
        | Citizen access                 | Not yet available                   |

        ## Patient resource versioning
        To update a patient's resource you must have retrieved it first, to ensure you are working against an up-to-date patient resource.

        When you retrieve a patient resource, you get a version number for the resource (in the `ETag` response header in the form `W/"2"` and in the `versionId` field in the response, in the form `"2"`).

        You must then pass the patient's version number in the update request (in the `If-Match` response header).

        It is recommended you use the value from the `Etag` header as this is in the correct form the `If-Match` header is expected, for example `W/"2"` and can be mirrored back in the request.

        The update will only succeed if the patient resource has not been updated in our database in the meantime.

        If the update succeeds, on polling the outcome, you will receive a copy of the update resource in the response, including the new resource version number.

        If you make a subsequent update you must use the new version number.

        ## JSON Patch
        To update a patient a [JSON Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) should be sent. A JSON Patch consists of one or more patch objects within a list.

        It is recommended that all desired updates are sent together in a single request as a list of patches.
        This is the most efficient approach and will reduce the danger of race conditions occurring when updating the patient multiple times in a short period of time.

        When processing the list of patch objects, each patch must be valid and pass all the business rules against the data. If one patch object fails, none of the patch objects will be applied.

        A patch object consists of:
        * an operation, `op` - this is required.
        * a path to the data that you want to change, `path` - this is required.
        * the value that will be assigned, `value` - this is required for `add`, `replace` and `test`; but should not be included for a `remove`.

        The following operations are supported:
        * `add` - to add a new value.
        * `replace` - to replace an existing value.
        * `remove` - to remove an existing value.
        * `test` - to test the state of a value is as expected before continuing with the update.

        Paths point to a single value, list or object, for example:
        * `/gender` - pointing to the gender value.
        * `/name` - point to the name list.
        * `/name/0` - pointing to the 1st object in the name list.
        * `/address/0/line/1` - pointing to the 2nd line string in the 1st address object.

        The value can be set to any valid value for that path, so could be a null, a string, an object or a list.

        ### Addition

        `add` should be used to add new items to a patient.

        Adding a simple data item such as the date of death can be done using a patch such as:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "add", "path": "/deceasedDate", "value": "2020-01-01" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Adding to a list such as a `name` should be done by including the whole object in the value field. Note, the list index is `-` this is because when adding to a list as the index will not be known:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              {
                    "op": "add",
                    "path": "/name/-",
                    "value": {
                        "use": "usual",
                        "period": { "start": "2019-12-31" },
                        "prefix": ["Dr"],
                        "given": [
                          "Joe",
                          "Horation",
                          "Maximus"
                        ],
                        "family": "Bloggs",
                        "suffix": ["PhD"]
                    }
                }
          ]
        }
        ```

        When adding a base level list item such as a new name or address, ensure the index is always `-`, otherwise the request will be rejected. For example, `/name/-`.
        The reason for this is because the backend system will make the decision on the ordering of the listed objects to ensure they are always returned in the same order.

        If you are adding to a sub-element that is a list, such as an additional given name, it is valid to provide an exact index. So the following is valid:

        ```json
        {
          "patches": [
            {
              "op": "add", "path": "/name/0/id", "value": "8F8B957D",
              "op": "add", "path": "/name/0/given/0", "value": "Rose"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        If is possible to `add` a sub-element to an existing object in a patch request. If the object already exists and you have the object `id`, you must supply it or the update will be rejected.
        The following patch is allowed:

        ```json
        {
          "patches": [
            {
              "op": "add", "path": "/name/0/id", "value": "8F8B957D",
              "op": "add", "path": "/name/0/given/-", "value": "Rose"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        but the following is not allowed:
        
        ```json
        {
          "patches": [
            {
              "op": "add", "path": "/name/0/given/-", "value": "Rose"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        ### Replacing

        `replace` should be used to alter existing items on the patient.

        Replacing a simple data item such as the gender can be done using a patch such as:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "replace", "path": "/gender", "value": "male" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Replacing a list item can be done in two ways which may be dependent on any external development libraries that can be used to create the patch.

        The first approach is to replace the whole list item:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              {
                    "op": "replace",
                    "path": "/name/0",
                    "value": {
                        "id": "123",
                        "use": "usual",
                        "period": { "start": "2019-12-31" },
                        "prefix": ["Dr"],
                        "given": [
                          "Joe",
                          "Horation",
                          "Maximus"
                        ],
                        "family": "Bloggs",
                        "suffix": ["PhD"]
                    }
                }
          ]
        }
        ```

        The second approach is to replace just a part, or parts, of the list object keys if all others will remain the same:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "replace", "path": "/name/0/id", "value": "123" },
              { "op": "replace", "path": "/name/0/prefix/0", "value": "Mr" },
              { "op": "replace", "path": "/name/0/family", "value": "Smith" }
            ]
        }
        ```

        An added requirement to ensure no accidental data loss or replacement of the wrong list item, you must always include the list `id` or `url`. This will be in the object on retrieval so just needs to be mirrored back. You should not include an ID on an addition as this will be automatically generated by the system and is a unique object ID, so only our system can guarantee that.

        ### Removal

        `remove` should be used to delete existing items on a patient.

        Removing a simple data item such as the gender can be done using a patch such as:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/gender" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Note, that in this scenario, although the patch is perfectly valid, the update will still be rejected as a patients gender cannot be removed.

        Removing a list item should only be done on the whole item object, not individual sub-items; instead use the replace operation.

        To remove a list item, a `test` operation must <u>immediately proceed</u> the `remove` . This is an added requirement to ensure no accidental data loss occurs or the wrong item is removed. The test operation should be used to assert either:

        * the `id` - the object ID for items that have one - for example `name`, `address` or `telecom`.
        * the `url` - the URL for the extension being removed.
        * the whole object being removed.

        An example of a list item removal using the `id` would be:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/0/id", "value": "123" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/0" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        An example of a extension list item removal using the `url` would be:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "test", "path": "/extension/0/url", "value": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/R4/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-DeathNotificationStatus" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/extension/0" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        An example of a list item removal using the whole object would be:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { 
                    "op": "test",
                    "path": "/name/0",
                    "value": {
                        "id": "123",
                        "use": "usual",
                        "period": { "start": "2019-12-31" },
                        "prefix": ["Dr"],
                        "given": [
                          "Joe",
                          "Horation",
                          "Maximus"
                        ],
                        "family": "Bloggs",
                        "suffix": ["PhD"]
                    }
                },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/0" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Special care should be taken when performing multiple removals in the same list; as removing a particular index could affect all subsequent index positions. The next two examples perform **<u>exactly</u>** the same operation.

        Using the following initial (simplified) data, with the intention of removing the names in index 1 (Irwin) and 2 (Bruce):

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "3", "family": "Irwin"},
                {"id": "4", "family": "Bruce"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        **Example 1**:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/1/id", "value": "3" }
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/1" },
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/1/id", "value": "4" }
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/1" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        After the 1st removal the data will look like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "4", "family": "Bruce"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        meaning Irwin has been removed, Bruce has moved from index 2 -> 1 and Sharpe from 3 -> 2.

        So after applying the 2nd removal the data will look like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        Which is the intended outcome. Using the same index 1 for both removals may look unexpected, but the way JSON Patch works is iterating over each patch operation in turn and making the change to the list index positions. This means a developer needs to account for lists changing from one operation to the next.

        **Example 2**:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/2/id", "value": "4" }
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/2" },
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/1/id", "value": "3" }
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/1" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        After the 1st removal the data will look like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "3", "family": "Irwin"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        Applying the 2nd removal the data will look like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        Which is the intended outcome. Providing the patches with the indexes descending means that the list stays in a stable format the whole way through as the only changes to the index positions are items have been passed over already.

        **Example 3 - a failure**

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/1/id", "value": "3" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/1" },
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/2/id", "value": "4" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/2" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        After the 1st removal the data will look like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "4", "family": "Bruce"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        When applying the 2nd test, it will fail as the index 2 ID is `5`, but the test was looking for `4`. An error will be returned and none of the updates provided would be made to the database.

        This failure example is a good reason for forcing the use of the `test` operation. If there was no test, index 2 would have been blindly removed, meaning the final state of the data would look like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "4", "family": "Bruce"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        Which is incorrect, as Irwin and Sharpe were removed instead of Irwin and Bruce.


        ## Patient data fields

        ### Address

        List item found under `address` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/address/0` if the address to be replaced or removed is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path will be `/address/1`, and so on.
        * `/address/-` when adding a new address.

        An address consists of 5 lines of unstructured text, postcode and PAF (Postcode Address File) key.
        Local systems must apply the following formatting convention when adding or replacing addresses lines:
        *	line 1 - premises ID and/or house name, e.g. `Flat 1` or `The Old Schoolhouse`
        *	line 2 - house number, dependent thoroughfare name and descriptor (if present), thoroughfare name and descriptor, e.g. `23 Mill Lane`
        *	line 3 - dependent locality/village, locality (if present), e.g. `Boxgrove`
        *	line 4 - post town, e.g. `Leeds`
        *	line 5 - county (if present), e.g. `West Yorkshire`

        When updating an address, lines 1 or 2, and line 4 should be populated; line 5 should not be included in manually created addresses but may be included in PAF derived addresses.

        Address lines should be populated otherwise the message may be rejected. There are exceptions:
        * if a postcode and PAF key are submitted, in which case the lines will be automatically populated, however if there are no matches or too many matches the message will be rejected due to missing address lines
        * a pseudo postcode is used. For example `ZZ99 3VZ` meaning `no fixed abode`

        When creating the FHIR payload message, to be fully FHIR compliant all empty lines should be removed, so for example:
        
        ```json
        {
            "address": {
                "line": [
                    "",
                    "23 Mill Lane",
                    "",
                    "Leeds",
                    ""
                ]
            }

        }
        ```

        should be sent in as:

        ```json
                {
                    "address": {
                        "line": [
                            "23 Mill Lane",
                            "Leeds",
                        ]
                    }

                }
        ```

        however if you do not do this the message will not be rejected; the response will be in that form though.

        To ensure consistent data across all patient addresses it is advised that the address data supplied should be matched to the PAF and sent in that format including the PAF key.
        If the PAF key is not included it will be added to the address if a match can be found, additionally the provided address lines and post code will be enriched and reformatted if necessary.

        The following address types are supported:
        * `home` - the home address is the patient's normal residence. Home address is also known as usual, main, registered, current or permanent address
        * `temp` - a temporary address is an address used for a set period of time, but where the patient's home, permanent address remains unchanged
        * `billing` - an address used for correspondence purposes only

        A patient should have no more than one current `temp` and/or `billing` address, attempting to add multiple will result in a error.
        However, historically this was constrained only by the integration requirements and was not enforced so theoretically more than one can exist for a patient when retrieving.
        Where multiple instances already exist for the patient it is not expected that local systems should manage those, but should choose the most appropriate one to maintain (e.g. by examining period dates).

        A `home` address is the patient's main residential address and should normally be used for all clinical and demographic purposes, including clinical and appointment correspondence.
        However additionally, `temp` and `billing` addresses may be provided by a patient when there is a requirement to record an alternative location for the purposes of unbroken care.
        When sending correspondence to a patient:
        *	a present and valid `billing` address may take precedence over `home` and `temp` addresses. A patient should have only a single current `billing` address. An address is considered 'valid' according to its period start and to dates.
        *	if no current `billing` address is provided, a `temp` address may take precedence over the `home` address, again if it is valid according to its period start and to dates.
        * if there is no valid, current `billing` and/or `temp` address, the `home` address must be used.

        It should be noted that not all local systems support `temp` and `billing` addresses, so these are not uniformly maintained. Therefore, where the patient contact has clinical or business significance, the precedence of these addresses over the `home` address should be determined by a user wherever possible.
        When the end date for a `temp` or `billing` address passes, local systems should use the patient’s `home` address. It will be extremely rare that no home address is present on a patient record.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * cannot add more than one of each address use types; `home`, `temp` or `billing`
        * `work` address `use` type is a valid response but cannot be added or replaced as it is a legacy value. An address with the `work` type can be removed though
        * any `temp` address must have both a `period start` and a `period end` date. The provision of a period end date has particular importance in order to avoid temporary addresses that are no longer relevant to the patient still being held as current data available to any system retrieving the patient record. A suggested default where no actual period end is known is 30 days later than the period start, up to a maximum of 3 months.
        * any `billing` address must have both a `period start` and a `period end` date. The provision of a period end date has particular importance in order to avoid correspondence addresses that are no longer relevant to the patient still being held as current data available to any system retrieving the patient record. A suggested default where no actual period end is known is 30 days later than the period start, up to a maximum of 12 months.
        * the date period is optional; where present they must be valid dates and the `end` date cannot be before the `start` date
        * the period `start` date is optional, however if provided cannot be a future date. If it is not provided it will default to the date of update
        * where a `temp` address is provided a description must be sent using the `text` field, the list of possible values are:
          * `Second Home` - a patient's second home
          * `Student Accommodation` - a patient's place of residence while at university
          * `Respite Care Address` - where the patient resides during respite care
          * `Temporary Residence Address` - where the patient resides for a specific period of time
          * `Convalescence Home` - the address for a patient during a period of recovery
          * `Mobile Home` - the address of a patient's mobile home, parked for a specific period of time, e.g. the address of a caravan park
          * `Holiday Home` - the address for a patient during a holiday

        ### Communication

        Single item found under `extension` with the extension URL `https://fhir.nhs.uk/R4/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-NHSCommunication`.

        In a JSON Patch request, where the communication extension doesn't exist the path should be:
        * `/extension/-` when adding a communication extension.

        Where you are replacing/removing the full communication extension, the path should be:
        * `/extension/0` if the communication extension is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path will be `/extension/1`, and so on.

        Where the communication extension already exists and you wish to replace a specific sub-extension, then the path should be:
        * `/extension/0/extension/1` if the communication extension is the first item in the list and the sub-extension is the second item in the list.
        
        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * preferred language must not be supplied where it is English even though the [code list](https://simplifier.net/ukcore/codesystem-ukcore-humanlanguage) contains a value for English (en).
        * any language codes outside the accepted list will be rejected; such as local system `qa` codes.

        ### Contact preferences
        Single item found under `extension` with the extension URL `https://fhir.nhs.uk/R4/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-ContactPreference`.

        In a JSON Patch request, where the Contact Preference extension doesn't exist or you are replacing/removing the full list of Contact preferences, the path should be:
        * `/extension/0` if the contact preference is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path will be `/extension/1`, and so on.
        * `/extension/-` when adding a contact preference.

        Where the Contact Preference extension already exists and you wish to add, replace or remove a specific contact preference(s) sub-extension, then the path should be:
        * `/extension/0/extension/1` if the contact preference extension is the first item in the list and the method is the second item in the sub-extension list.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * a patient can have `0` or `1` contact preference.
        * preferred contact time is a free-text field limited to 40 characters.
        * where a contact time is specified a contact method must also exist.

        Only emergency contact details should be added to `contact`, regular telecommunication methods such as home phone should be added to the `telecom` field.
        Any other contact relationship types will be rejected.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * in any telecom child object the `use` key should not be present.
        * in any telecom child object the system cannot be `fax`.
        * the date period is optional; where present they must be valid dates and the `end` date cannot be before the `start` date.
        * the period `start` date is optional, however if provided cannot be a future date. If it is not provided it will default to the date of update.
        * the date period, if present, should be on the parent `contact` object and not any `telecom` child objects.
        * if the telecom system is `email`, the value must be a valid email format, for example `john.smith@nhs.net`; be more than 6 characters and less than 90 characters
        * the relationship can only be `C` meaning `Emergency Contact`

        ### Gender

        Single item found under `gender` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be `/gender`.

        When setting a gender, the local system should encourage the user to select `male` or `female` rather than `unknown`.
        The fourth value of gender, `other`, meaning indeterminate; i.e. unable to be classified as either male or female; should never pro-actively be set by local systems - although this value can be retrieved due to legacy data or data quality issues.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
          * cannot be removed.
          * can only be `male`, `female` or `unknown`.
          * cannot set gender to `other`.

        ### General practice

        List item found under `generalPractitioner` field. Although only a single general practice is allowed.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/generalPractitioner/0` for replacing or removing the general practice.
        * `/generalPractitioner/-` when adding a new general practice.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * only valid GP Practice codes may be used, see [Organisation Data Service FHIR API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/) for more details on valid codes.
        * the period `start` date is optional, however if provided cannot be a future date. If it is not provided it will default to the date of update.
        * do not provide a period `end` date.
        * the general practice should only be updated by primary care systems, [NHAIS](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhais) or by the National Back Office.
        * removal of a general practice can only be done by [NHAIS](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhais) or by the National Back Office.
        * only a single general practice is supported; emergency, temporary and additional practices must be maintained in the local system only.

        ### Multiple birth order

        Single item found under `multipleBirthInteger` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be `/multipleBirthInteger`.

        When adding or updating the birth order, the update should be an integer in the range `1` - `9` inclusive. These values have differing meanings:
        * 1 - 7 indicates the order of birth, with 1 indicating the first or only birth in the sequence, 2 indicating the second birth in the sequence, 3 indicating the third, and so on up to 7.
        * 8 - `Not applicable`
        * 9 - `Not known`

        ### Name

        List item found under `name` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/name/0` if the name to be replaced or removed is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path will be `/name/1`, and so on.
        * `/name/-` when adding a new name.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * cannot add more than one `usual` name.
        * cannot remove the `usual` name.
        * cannot add more than one `nickname`.
        * can have multiple instances of all other name use types.
        * cannot replace the use type on an existing name. For example, once a name is a nickname, it cannot be changed directly to an alias. You must instead remove the nickname and add the alias.
        * the first character of each `suffix` item must be `A-Z`.
        * the date period is optional; where present they must be valid dates and the `end` date cannot be before the `start` date.
        * the period `start` date is optional, however if provided cannot be a future date. If it is not provided it will default to the date of update.
        * supplied name data must be UTF-8 encodable.
        * the `period` is optional, but if included the `end` date cannot be before the `start` date. They can however be in the past, present or future.
        * the full available range of generally recognised titles are permitted, however, if any of the following are used then the value input must conform to the following format:
            * Mr
            * Mrs
            * Ms
            * Dr
            * Rev

            * Lady
            * Lord
        * any trailing full stops at the end of a prefix will be automatically removed; for example `Mrs.` will be changed to `Mrs`.

        ### Pharmacy

        Single item found under `extension` with one of the extension urls:
        * `https://fhir.nhs.uk/R4/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-NominatedPharmacy`

        * `https://fhir.nhs.uk/R4/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-PreferredDispenserOrganization`

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/extension/0` if the pharmacy is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path will be `/extension/1`, and so on
        * `/extension/-` when adding a pharmacy

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * multiple pharmacies are allowed, however only one of each type
        * there are no effective date periods, only a single current instance of each type is supported
        * only valid National Pharmacy codes may be used for the pharmacy identifier, see [Organisation Data Service FHIR API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/) for more details on valid codes

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/telecom/0` if the telecom to be replaced or removed is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path will be `/telecom/1`, and so on
        * `/telecom/-` when adding a new telecom

        Emergency contact details should not be added to the `telecom` field, instead they should be added to the `contact` field.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * the date period is optional; where present they must be valid dates and the `end` date cannot be before the `start` date
        * the period `start` date is optional, however if provided cannot be a future date. If it is not provided it will default to the date of update.

        ## Sandbox test scenarios

        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment.

        Things to note when using the sandbox for PATCH:
        * Your changes will not be persisted.
        * JSON Patch operations themselves are validated, but the resulting resource is not validated for correctness; meaning any business rules are not applied.
        * You can use the patient with minimal data, `9000000033` to test adding all data types (as most of them are missing on this patient), that would normally be present (e.g. gender).

        You can try out the sandbox using the "Try this API" feature on this page.

        Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:
        
        [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/7ca0d7d9e12a851fd335)

        ### Download Postman client

        If you don’t have it, you can download Postman [here](https://www.postman.com).   
    
        Click on the download button in the top right corner and follow the instructions.

        ### Download our collection

        If you already have the Postman client installed - click onto our postman collection (button above) - then click onto the ‘Postman for Windows’ or ‘Postman for Mac’ version - and click Open when prompted.
    
        Postman client should then open showing our Patient Demographics Sandbox.

        If you have already downloaded the Sandbox collection from one of our other endpoints, found under the PDS FHIR API pages, you don't have to download it again as the same collection covers all endpoints.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to get a patient's related people details from PDS for a given NHS Number. This is a list of people who can be contacted, and how, regarding the patient. These details may be useful for a practitioner to get in contact with a next of kin or guardian.
        
        ## Restricted patients
        Some patients are tagged as [restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/restricting-access-to-a-patients-demographic-record), or sensitive. Related people will not be returned for a restricted patient and an empty bundle will be returned.

        If a related person only contains a patient reference reference, and when the patient is retrieved, it is restricted; location sensitive fields such as `address` and `telecom` will be removed.

        ## Sandbox test scenarios
        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

        | Scenario                        | Request                                       | Response                                                      |
        | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | Multiple related people exists  | `id`=`9000000009`                             | HTTP Status 200 with related person data in a response Bundle |
        | Single related person exists    | `id`=`9000000017`                             | HTTP Status 200 with related person data in a response Bundle |
        | Related people do not exist     | `id`=`9000000025`                             | HTTP Status 404 with problem description                      |

        You can try out the sandbox using the "Try this API" feature on this page.

        Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:
        
        [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/7ca0d7d9e12a851fd335)

        ### Download Postman client

        If you don’t have it, you can download Postman [here](https://www.postman.com).   
    
        Click on the download button in the top right corner and follow the instructions.

        ### Download our collection

        If you already have the Postman client installed - click onto our postman collection (button above) - then click onto the ‘Postman for Windows’ or ‘Postman for Mac’ version - and click Open when prompted.
    
        Postman client should then open showing our Patient Demographics Sandbox.

        If you have already downloaded the Sandbox collection from one of our other endpoints, found under the PDS FHIR API pages, you don't have to download it again as the same collection covers all endpoints.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to poll for the outcome of an updated patient record.

        When updating resources the request is dealt with in an asynchronous manner.
        
        Once the initial request is accepted a `202` response will be returned with a `Content-Location` header, use this location to poll for the outcome. It will be in the form `/_poll/<message id>`.

        Requests should be sent to the polling endpoint until a `202` response is no longer returned and the response is dealt with appropriately.

        Polls should be done at a reasonable frequency to avoid excess traffic; the `Retry-After` header will provide the time to wait in milliseconds between polls, although polling with a larger gap is also allowed.
        Retrieval of the outcome will not occur any faster by polling more frequently. The server will simply return a cached response.

        ## Sandbox test scenarios
        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

        | Scenario                                                   | Request                                               | Response                                    |
        | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------|
        | Perform a valid patch request and use the content-location | `message_id` whatever was in update accepted response | HTTP Status 200 with updated patient data   |
        | Polling message ID when update is not yet complete         | `message_id`=`20200522091633363041_000001`            | HTTP Status 202 with no data                |
        | Polling message ID not found                               | `message_id`=`20200522091633363041_000002`            | HTTP Status 404 with operation outcome body |
