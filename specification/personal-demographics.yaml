  title: Personal Demographics Service (FHIR) API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics) - the national electronic database of NHS patient details such as name, address, date of birth, related people, registered GP and NHS number.

    You can:
    * search for patients
    * get patient details
    * update patient details
    * verify an NHS number for a patient

    You cannot currently use this API to:
    * create a new record for a birth
    * receive birth notifications
    * create a record for a new patient
    * register a new patient at a GP Practice - instead, use [NHAIS GP Links API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhais-gp-links)
 
    You can read and update the following data:
    * NHS number (read only)
    * name
    * gender
    * addresses and contact details
    * birth information
    * death information
    * registered GP
    * nominated pharmacy
    * dispensing doctor pharmacy
    * medical appliance supplier pharmacy
    * related people, such as next of kin (read only - update coming soon)
    
    ### Patients included in PDS
    Regardless of nationality, or where they live now, PDS includes all patients who have ever been registered with a GP practice, or treated by a health or care organisation (even as a visitor or migrant) in England, Wales, the Isle of Man, or in a UK Defence Medical Services unit anywhere in the world. 

    All patients in PDS have an NHS number which is unique. The 10-digit NHS number is used in England, Wales, the Isle of Man, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not the Channel Islands. Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own distinct number ranges.

    ### Access modes
    This API has three access modes:
    
    
    | Access mode                    | End user authentication                             | Functions          | Availability |
    | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
    | Application-restricted access  | None                                                | Search for patients (single result), Get patient details | Available in production (beta) | 
    | Healthcare worker access       | NHS Care Identity Service 2 (NHS CIS2) using NHS smartcard or [modern alternative](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-care-identity-service-2/ways-to-authenticate-with-nhs-cis2)  | Search for patients (multiple results), Get patient details, Update patient details | Available in production (beta) |
    | Citizen access                 | NHS login                                           | Get own details, Update own details (limited) | Not available yet, see [backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/107446/pds-fhir-api-citizen-access-using-nhs-login) for details   |

  
    ## Who can use this API
    This API can only be used where there is a [legal basis](http://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/access-data-on-the-personal-demographics-service) to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.  To do this, make a [PDS access request](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/access-data-on-the-personal-demographics-service). 
    
    You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

    ### Who can access PDS records
    Health and care organisations in England and the Isle of Man can access PDS records. Legitimate direct care examples include NHS organisations delivering healthcare, local authorities delivering care, third sector and private sector health and care organisations, and developers delivering systems to health and care organisations. 

    Health and care organisations in Wales access their own version of PDS called the Welsh Demographics Service (WDS) which is connected to PDS behind the scenes. 

    Health and care organisations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands access their own equivalents of PDS.

    ## Related APIs
    The following APIs also give access to the Personal Demographics Service:
    - [Personal Demographics Service (SMSP) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine/spine-mini-service-provider-for-personal-demographics-service) - use this if you want to get PDS data without an authenticated end user (no smartcard required). It is, however, read-only and searches are limited to a single result.
    - [Personal Demographics Service (HL7 V3) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-hl7-v3) - use this if you want to use functions that are not yet available on the FHIR API.

    Once our roadmap is complete, the above APIs will become redundant.

    The following APIs are also related to this API:
    - [Personal Demographics Service Notifications - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-notifications-fhir) - use this to subscribe to be notified of a limited set of patient record changes, such as birth, death, change of address and change of GP. If you would like to see this list expanded, please tell us about your use case and vote [here](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/184902/pds-to-proactively-tell-a-gp-system-when-a-patient-record-is-updated)
    - [Organisation Data Service FHIR API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/) - use this to get full details for the organisations related to the patient, such as their registered GP or nominated pharmacy.

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).

    It also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.
    Specifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.

    You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Patient` not `/patients`
    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    To use this API with NHS smartcards you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives are available.
    
    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
    
    ## Security and authorisation
    ### Application-restricted access
    This access mode is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis),
    meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.
    
    You can use this access mode as follows:
    * unattended (end user not present), for example as part of a back end process to check NHS numbers for data flowing from one system to another
    * attended (end user present) - in which case, you must ensure the end user is authenticated and suitably authorised locally by the calling application
    
    To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:
    * [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)
    
    ### Healthcare worker access
    This access mode is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
    meaning an end user must be present, authenticated and authorised.

    The end user must be:
    - a healthcare worker
    - strongly authenticated, using either an NHS smartcard or a [modern alternative](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-care-identity-service-2/ways-to-authenticate-with-nhs-cis2)
    - authorised, using [national role-based access control (RBAC)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/national-rbac-for-developers)

    To use this access mode, use one of the following security patterns:
    * [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - combined authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-combined-authentication-and-authorisation)
    * [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    ### Citizen access
    This access mode is not available yet.

    | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Sandbox           | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/personal-demographics/FHIR/R4/`    |
    | Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/personal-demographics/FHIR/R4/`        |
    | Production        | `https://api.service.nhs.uk/personal-demographics/FHIR/R4/`            |

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is stateless, so does not actually persist any updates
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:
    
    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/14719036-953f067f-30b9-4552-8252-7cc10b21dad3)

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with options for user-restricted access (with or without smartcard) and application-restricted access
         
    For read-only testing, you can either use our [PDS FHIR API test data packs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir/pds-fhir-api-test-data) or set up your own test data.
    
    To test updating patient details, you must set up your own test data.

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ### Production smoke testing
    You must not use real patient data for smoke testing in the production environment.
    
    Rather, use our [production test patient](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir/pds-fhir-api-test-data#production-smoke-testing).

    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.
    
    To onboard for this API, follow the [Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL) process.](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/onboarding-process#onboard-using-the-supplier-conformance-assessment-list-scal-process)

    When following the SCAL process, note that:
    * In step 1: to confirm your use case for this API, you need to [make a PDS access request](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/access-data-on-the-personal-demographics-service), even if you already access PDS via another method.
    * In step 2: when requesting the SCAL, tell us (a) which access mode you're using: (i) healthcare worker search and retrieve, (ii) healthcare worker update or (iii) application-restricted; (b) for healthcare worker access, which security pattern you are using: (i) combined authentication and authorisation or (ii) separate authentication and authorisation
    * In step 6: when implementing your clinical risk management process, you must review and integrate the PDS FHIR API hazard log into your own risk log. It's embedded within the PDS FHIR API tab in the SCAL.
    * In step 8: you need to review and complete the PDS FHIR API risk log to show that you have understood and mitigated the various risks. You might be asked to provide some evidence to prove that controls have been put in place. You can find the risk log embedded within the PDS FHIR API tab in the SCAL. This is separate from the clinical safety hazard log mentioned above.
    * In step 9: you must conduct penetration testing to [CHECK standards](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/check-penetration-testing).
    * In step 10: when you complete the Service Desk Registration Form, send it to [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).
    * In step 11: submit your completed SCAL to [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).
    * In step 14: to request production access, contact us at [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to search for a patient in PDS.
        
        You can search using various combinations of:
          * given name
          * family name
          * gender
          * postcode
          * date of birth - which can be a range
          * date of death - which can be a range
          * registered GP practice
          
        There are various search options, such as fuzzy search, exact match, history and wildcards.
        
        The behaviour of this endpoint depends on which access mode you are using:
        
        | Access mode                    | Behaviour                                  |
        | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
        | Application-restricted access  | Only a single unique match returned        |
        | Healthcare worker access       | Up to 50 matching patient records returned |
        | Citizen access                 | Not yet available                          |

        ## Search options
        The following sections explain the various search options.
        Which options you choose depends very much on your use case, and getting it right is really important.
        If you need help, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

        ### Application-restricted access mode
        In this access mode, you only get a single matching patient record, and only if it's a unique match.

        Use search options that are likely to find a unique match. In our experience, the following is a good starting point:
          * search on given name, family name, postcode and date of birth - this combination should uniquely identify a patient
          * for given name, use the first three characters and a wildcard, for example to search for `Annabel`, use `Ann*` - this caters for different name spellings and abbreviations
          * for postcode, use the first two characters and a wildcard, for example to search for `LS11 6AD`, use `LS*` - this caters for people who have moved locally but not updated PDS
          * use a non-fuzzy search - this reduces the chance of multiple matches
          * use a non-exact match - an exact match does not work with wildcards
          * include history - this increases the chance of a match

        For more details, see the following sections.

        ### Healthcare worker access mode
        In this access mode - where the end user is a strongly authenticated healthcare worker - you can get up to 50 matching patient records.
        This allows the end user to choose the best match.

        Use search parameters that are relevant to your use case - for example date of death is not always appropriate.
        
        To protect patient privacy, design your search to minimise the number of matching patients.
        For example, you could:
          * encourage users to enter as many search parameters as they can
          * force users to try a non-fuzzy search first and then only offer a fuzzy search if they cannot find the patient
        
        For more details, see the following sections.

        ### Non-fuzzy search
        A non-fuzzy search:
          * allows wildcards in names and postcodes
          * does not match homophones or transposed names
          * can optionally search history, such as previous names and addresses

        It is less likely to return multiple matches than a fuzzy search, so is more suitable for finding a unique match.

        The minimum search parameters are:
          * family name - which can include wildcards
          * date of birth - which can be a range
          
        ### Fuzzy search
        A fuzzy search:
          * matches common homophones, such as `Smith` and `Smythe`, using the [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) algorithm
          * checks for transposed names, such as `Adam Thomas` and `Thomas Adam`
          * always searches history, such as previous names and addresses

        It is more likely to include multiple matches than a non-fuzzy search, so is not ideal for finding a unique match.
        
        It is also more likely to include false positives - other patients that match the search criteria.
        Therefore, for privacy reasons, it is better to use it only if a non-fuzzy match has failed.

        You must use one of the following search parameter combinations:
          * given name, family name and date of birth
          * family name, date of birth, gender and postcode
          * given name, date of birth, gender and postcode

        If you include the date of death or registered GP practice query parameters, they are not used in the search. However they do affect the patient's matching score - a mismatch reduces the returned score.

        ### History
        PDS holds historic information, including previous names and addresses.

        A fuzzy search always includes history. For a non-fuzzy search, you can request to include history.

        Searching history can match patients where only a previous name or address is known, or if a patient provides a previous name or address on the assumption that their record hasn’t been updated.

        ### Exact match
        You can request an exact match.
        This might be useful if you are verifying an NHS number against details you already believe to be correct.
        It is unlikely to work well with wildcards or fuzzy search.

        ### Names
        Matching names can be difficult due to:
          * multiple given names, such as in `Jane Anne Smith`
          * multiple or double-barrelled surnames, such as in `Michael Smith-Jones`
          * homophones, such as `Smith` and `Smythe` or `Ann` and `Anne`
          * abbreviated names, such as `Bob` instead of `Robert`
          * transposed names, such as `Adam Thomas` instead of `Thomas Adam`
          * previous names, such as maiden names
          * special characters such as in `O'Reilly`, `Jones-Smith` or `Kociński`
          * spelling mistakes, either in the search criteria or in PDS

        To deal with some of these issues:
          * we always search all given names
          * we search across all types of name - usual, nickname and temporary
          * a fuzzy search matches homophones, transposed names and previous names
          * for a non fuzzy search, you can optionally use wildcards and search previous names

        ### Gender
        PDS has four options for gender - `male`, `female`, `other` and `unknown`.
        For some people, the gender held in PDS might not match the gender they identify with.

        In these cases, searching by gender might not find the patient.
        These are edge cases but are important to consider because gender can be a sensitive issue for the people in question.

        In general, we recommend not including gender as a search parameter.
          
        ### Date of birth and death
        Sometimes, the exact date of birth or death is not known when doing a search.
        Sometimes, the date of birth or death is not accurate in PDS.
        For example, if only the year of birth is known, the day and month of birth might be recorded as the first of January - for example, `01/01/1932`.

        In such cases, searching a range of dates can help. This can result in multiple matches, so might not work well when searching for a unique match.

        ### Postcode
        People sometimes move locally, meaning the postcode in PDS is out of date, but does at least match on the first two characters.

        Searching for the first two characters of the postcode and a wildcard can work well. For example, to search for `LS11 6AD`, use `LS*`.
        This is only possible for a non-fuzzy search.
        
        This can result in multiple matches, but it has been known to work well in some cases - even for unique matches.

        ### General practitioner
        This is an ODS code. If you use it, it must match exactly.

        ## Patient data returned
        The patient data returned on a search is not the full set of data that is returned on a retrieval by NHS number. The following data is included:
        * NHS number
        * names - usual, nickname and temporary
        * gender
        * birth information, apart from place of birth
        * death information
        * address - home address
        * contact details
        * registered GP
        * restricted patient flag

        The following data is excluded:
        * place of birth
        * names, apart from usual, nickname and temporary 
        * addresses, apart from home address
        * pharmacy details
        * communication details
        * contact preferences

        ### Restricted patients
        Some patients are tagged as [restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/restricting-access-to-a-patients-demographic-record), or sensitive. When performing a search, restricted patients can be returned; however, location sensitive fields such as `address`, `telecom`, `contact` and `generalPractitioner` are removed.

        If `address-postcode` or `general-practitioner` are included in the search parameters, no restricted patients are returned even if a match is identified.

        The restricted flag can be found in the data under `meta/security` on the patient resource.
        
        ### Invalidated patients
        Some patients are marked as invalidated in PDS - also known as `redacted` in FHIR terminology. Invalidated patient records are not returned in search results.
        If an invalidated patient record has been superseded, the superseding record is returned.

        ## Scoring
        Every matched patient in the result list includes a score to indicate how closely the patient matched the search parameters.

        A score of 1.0 indicates an exact match. A score of less than 1.0 indicates a partial match.

        The result list is sorted in descending score order - best match first.

        Use the `_exact-match` query parameter to return exact matches only - where the score is 1.0.

        ## Clinical safety and privacy
        This endpoint can return multiple matching patients for a given search, including partial matches.

        Ensure that you design your software to minimise the following risks:
        * an end user selects the wrong patient from the results presented, so there is a risk of clinical harm; for example due to retrieval of the wrong clinical data
        * the end user has access to patients’ personal data, so there is a risk to patient privacy

        Note that:
        * we record an access request in our audit trail for all patients matched in a PDS search
        * it is almost certainly a good idea to display search results in descending score order - best match first
        
        ## Sandbox testing
        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

        | Scenario                    | Request                                                      | Response                                   |

        | Wildcard search             | `family`=`Sm*`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22` | HTTP Status 200 with search result of two. |
        | Search with limited results | `family`=`Sm*`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22`, `_max-results`=`2` | HTTP Status 200 with search result of two. |
        | Search with date range      | `family`=`Smith`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`ge2010-10-21`, `birthdate`=`le2010-10-23` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |
        | Fuzzy search                | `family`=`Smith`, `given`=`Jane` `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22`, `_fuzzy-match`=`true` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |
        | Restricted patient search   | `family`=`Smythe`, `given`=`Janet` `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2005-06-16` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result with restricted data omitted. |
        | Unsuccessful search         | Any other valid search query parameters                      | HTTP Status 200 with no search results     |
        | Invalid date format         | `birthdate` or `death-date` query parameters with values not in format `YYYY-MM-DD` | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |
        | Too few search parameters   | Any invalid combination of query parameters                  | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |
        | Missing X-Request-ID        | `id`=`9000000009` (or any other valid NHS number)            | HTTP Status 412 with problem description   |

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to get patient details from PDS for a given NHS number.
        
        You cannot get a patient's related people details, use the RelatedPerson endpoint instead.

        ## Superseded patients
        Some patients are marked as superseded, this means that for some reason the original resource is no longer valid and has been replaced with a different resource.

        On retrieval of a superseded resource, the new resource is automatically returned in place of the requested resource. You can spot a superseded resource when the `id` is not the same as the one requested.

        When retrieving a superseding resource you must update your system with the new resource and remove the superseded resource, ensuring that the same `id` does not exist against another resource in your system.

        ## Restricted patients
        Some patients are tagged as [restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/restricting-access-to-a-patients-demographic-record), or sensitive. Restricted patients can be retrieved; however, location sensitive fields such as `address`, `telecom` and `generalPractitioner` are removed.

        The restricted flag can be found in the data under `meta/security` on the patient resource.

        ## Sandbox test scenarios
        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to update patient details in PDS.

        This is a 'patch' operation - you can update specific parts of the patient record, such as name or gender, without having to update the entire record.

        When you make a PATCH request with your application, the endpoint will respond with a successful (200) response code, along with the updated patient resource, or, an unsuccessful (4xx/5xx) response. 

        99.99% of all updates complete in under 10 seconds. If an update takes longer than 10 seconds, the endpoint responds with an HTTP status of 503 (Gateway Timeout). 
        
        You can alter the timeout period using the `X-Sync-Wait` header. If you re-submit the update, use the same `X-Request-ID` header.
        
        The behaviour of this endpoint depends on which access mode you are using:
        
        | Access mode                    | Behaviour restrictions              |
        | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
        | Application-restricted access  | Updates not allowed                 |
        | Healthcare worker access       | Updates allowed                     |
        | Citizen access                 | Not yet available                   |

        ## Patient resource versioning
        To update a patient's resource you must have retrieved it first, to ensure you are working against an up-to-date patient resource.

        When you retrieve a patient resource, you get a version number for the resource (in the `ETag` response header in the form `W/"2"` and in the `versionId` field in the response, in the form `"2"`).

        You must then pass the patient's version number in the update request (in the `If-Match` response header).

        It is recommended you use the value from the `Etag` header as this is in the correct form the `If-Match` header is expected, for example `W/"2"` and can be mirrored back in the request.

        The update only succeeds, if the patient resource has not been updated in our database between your first retrieval and the update request.

        If the update succeeds, you will receive the updated patient resource, this will contain the new resource version number.

        If you make a subsequent update you must use the new version number.

        ## JSON Patch
        To update a patient record, a [JSON Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) should be sent. A JSON Patch consists of one or more patch objects within a list.

        It is recommended that all desired updates are sent together in a single request as a list of patches.
        This is the most efficient approach and reduces the danger of race conditions occurring when updating the patient record multiple times in a short period of time.

        When processing the list of patch objects, each patch must be valid and pass all the business rules against the data. If one patch object fails, none of the patch objects are applied.

        A patch object consists of:
        * an operation, `op` - this is required.
        * a path to the data that you want to change, `path` - this is required.
        * the value that is assigned, `value` - this is required for `add`, `replace` and `test`; but should not be included for a `remove`.

        The following operations are supported:
        * `add` - to add a new value.
        * `replace` - to replace an existing value.
        * `remove` - to remove an existing value.
        * `test` - to test the state of a value is as expected before continuing with the update.

        Paths point to a single value, list or object, for example:
        * `/gender` - pointing to the gender value.
        * `/name` - point to the name list.
        * `/name/0` - pointing to the 1st object in the name list.
        * `/address/0/line/1` - pointing to the 2nd line string in the 1st address object.

        The value can be set to any valid value for that path, so could be a null, a string, an object or a list.

        ### Addition

        `add` should be used to add new items to a patient.

        Adding a simple data item such as the date of death can be done using a patch such as:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "add", "path": "/deceasedDate", "value": "2020-01-01" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Adding to a list such as a `name` should be done by including the whole object in the value field. Note, the list index is `-` this is because when adding to a list, the index is not known:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              {
                    "op": "add",
                    "path": "/name/-",
                    "value": {
                        "use": "usual",
                        "period": { "start": "2019-12-31" },
                        "prefix": ["Dr"],
                        "given": [
                          "Joe",
                          "Horation",
                          "Maximus"
                        ],
                        "family": "Bloggs",
                        "suffix": ["PhD"]
                    }
                }
          ]
        }
        ```

        When adding a base level list item such as a new name or address, ensure the index is always `-`, otherwise the request is rejected. For example, `/name/-`.
        The reason for this is because the backend system makes the decision on the ordering of the listed objects to ensure they are always returned in the same order.

        If you are adding to a sub-element that is a list, such as an additional given name, it is valid to provide an exact index. So the following is valid:

        ```json
        {
          "patches": [
            {
              "op": "add", "path": "/name/0/id", "value": "8F8B957D"
            },
            {
              "op": "add", "path": "/name/0/given/0", "value": "Rose"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        It is possible to `add` a sub-element to an existing object in a patch request. If the object already exists and you have the object `id`, you must supply it or the update is rejected.
        The following patch is allowed:

        ```json
        {
          "patches": [
            {
              "op": "add", "path": "/name/0/id", "value": "8F8B957D"
            },
            {
              "op": "add", "path": "/name/0/given/0", "value": "Rose"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        but the following is not allowed:
        
        ```json
        {
          "patches": [
            {
              "op": "add", "path": "/name/0/given/-", "value": "Rose"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        ### Replacing

        `replace` should be used to alter existing items on the patient.

        Replacing a simple data item such as the gender can be done using a patch such as:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "replace", "path": "/gender", "value": "male" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Replacing a list item can be done in two ways which may be dependent on any external development libraries that can be used to create the patch.

        The first approach is to replace the whole list item:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              {
                    "op": "replace",
                    "path": "/name/0",
                    "value": {
                        "id": "123",
                        "use": "usual",
                        "period": { "start": "2019-12-31" },
                        "prefix": ["Dr"],
                        "given": [
                          "Joe",
                          "Horation",
                          "Maximus"
                        ],
                        "family": "Bloggs",
                        "suffix": ["PhD"]
                    }
                }
          ]
        }
        ```

        The second approach is to replace just a part, or parts, of the list object keys if all others remain the same:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "replace", "path": "/name/0/id", "value": "123" },
              { "op": "replace", "path": "/name/0/prefix/0", "value": "Mr" },
              { "op": "replace", "path": "/name/0/family", "value": "Smith" }
            ]
        }
        ```

        An added requirement to ensure no accidental data loss or replacement of the wrong list item, you must always include the list `id` or `url`. This is in the object on retrieval so just needs to be mirrored back. You should not include an ID on an addition as this is automatically generated by the system and is a unique object ID, so only our system can guarantee that.

        ### Removal

        `remove` should be used to delete existing items on a patient.

        Removing a simple data item such as the gender can be done using a patch such as:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/gender" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Note, that in this scenario, although the patch is perfectly valid, the update is still rejected as a patients gender cannot be removed.

        Removing a list item should only be done on the whole item object, not individual sub-items; instead use the replace operation.

        To remove a list item, a `test` operation must <u>immediately proceed</u> the `remove` . This is an added requirement to ensure no accidental data loss occurs or the wrong item is removed. The test operation should be used to assert either:

        * the `id` - the object ID for items that have one - for example `name`, `address` or `telecom`.
        * the `url` - the URL for the extension being removed.
        * the whole object being removed.

        An example of a list item removal using the `id` would be:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/0/id", "value": "123" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/0" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        An example of a extension list item removal using the `url` would be:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "test", "path": "/extension/0/url", "value": "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-DeathNotificationStatus" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/extension/0" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        An example of a list item removal using the whole object would be:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { 
                    "op": "test",
                    "path": "/name/0",
                    "value": {
                        "id": "123",
                        "use": "usual",
                        "period": { "start": "2019-12-31" },
                        "prefix": ["Dr"],
                        "given": [
                          "Joe",
                          "Horation",
                          "Maximus"
                        ],
                        "family": "Bloggs",
                        "suffix": ["PhD"]
                    }
                },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/0" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Special care should be taken when performing multiple removals in the same list; as removing a particular index could affect all subsequent index positions. The next two examples perform **<u>exactly</u>** the same operation.

        Using the following initial (simplified) data, with the intention of removing the names in index 1 (Irwin) and 2 (Bruce):

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "3", "family": "Irwin"},
                {"id": "4", "family": "Bruce"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        **Example 1**:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/1/id", "value": "3" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/1" },
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/1/id", "value": "4" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/1" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        After the 1st removal the data looks like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "4", "family": "Bruce"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        meaning Irwin has been removed, Bruce has moved from index 2 -> 1 and Sharpe from 3 -> 2.

        So after applying the 2nd removal the data looks like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        Which is the intended outcome. Using the same index 1 for both removals may look unexpected, but the way JSON Patch works is iterating over each patch operation in turn and making the change to the list index positions. This means a developer needs to account for lists changing from one operation to the next.

        **Example 2**:

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/2/id", "value": "4" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/2" },
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/1/id", "value": "3" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/1" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        After the 1st removal the data looks like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "3", "family": "Irwin"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        Applying the 2nd removal the data looks like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        Which is the intended outcome. Providing the patches with the indexes descending means that the list stays in a stable format the whole way through as the only changes to the index positions are items have been passed over already.

        **Example 3 - a failure**

        ```json
        {
            "patches": [
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/1/id", "value": "3" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/1" },
              { "op": "test", "path": "/name/2/id", "value": "4" },
              { "op": "remove", "path": "/name/2" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        After the 1st removal the data looks like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "4", "family": "Bruce"},
                {"id": "5", "family": "Sharpe"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        When applying the 2nd test, it fails as the index 2 ID is `5`, but the test was looking for `4`. An error is returned and none of the updates provided would be made to the database.

        This failure example is a good reason for forcing the use of the `test` operation. If there was no test, index 2 would have been blindly removed, meaning the final state of the data would look like:

        ```json
        {
            "name": [
                {"id": "2", "family": "Parker"},
                {"id": "4", "family": "Bruce"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        Which is incorrect, as Irwin and Sharpe were removed instead of Irwin and Bruce.


        ## Patient data fields

        ### Address

        List item found under `address` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/address/0` if the address to be replaced or removed is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path is `/address/1`, and so on.
        * `/address/-` when adding a new address.

        An address consists of 5 lines of unstructured text, postcode and PAF (Postcode Address File) key.
        
        Postcode is optional but strongly encouraged.
        If the address has no postcode, use a [pseudo postcode from the list defined by the Office for National Statistics](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/data-downloads/office-for-national-statistics-data) (see the ‘look_ups’ file).
        
        In particular, for a patient at no fixed abode, use the pseudo postcode `ZZ99 3VZ`.
        
        When adding or replacing address lines, use the following rules:
        *	line 1 - premises ID and/or house name, for example `Flat 1` or `The Old Schoolhouse`
        *	line 2 - house number, dependent thoroughfare name and descriptor (if present), thoroughfare name and descriptor, for example `23 Mill Lane`
        *	line 3 - dependent locality/village, locality (if present), for example `Boxgrove`
        *	line 4 - post town, for example `Leeds`
        *	line 5 - county (if present), for example `West Yorkshire`
        
        When updating an address, you must populate lines 1 or 2, and line 4. You should not include line 5 in manually created addresses but you may include it in PAF-derived addresses.

        There are exceptions:
        * if you submit a postcode and PAF key, in which case the lines are automatically populated, however if there are no matches or too many matches the message is rejected due to missing address lines
        * if you use a pseudo postcode, for example `ZZ99 3VZ` meaning `no fixed abode`

        When creating the FHIR payload message, to be fully FHIR compliant all empty lines should be removed, so for example:
        
        ```json
        {
            "address": {
                "line": [
                    "",
                    "23 Mill Lane",
                    "",
                    "Leeds",
                    ""
                ]
            }

        }
        ```

        should be sent in as:

        ```json
                {
                    "address": {
                        "line": [
                            "23 Mill Lane",
                            "Leeds"
                        ]
                    }

                }
        ```

        however if you do not do this the message is not rejected; the response is in that form though.

        To ensure consistent data across all patient addresses, you should match addresses to the PAF and send them in PAF format including the PAF key.
        If you do not include the PAF key it is added to the address if a match is found
        Additionally the provided address lines and post code are enriched and reformatted if necessary.

        The following address types are supported:
        * `home` - the home address is the patient's normal residence. Home address is also known as usual, main, registered, current or permanent address
        * `temp` - a temporary address is an address used for a set period of time, but where the patient's home, permanent address remains unchanged
        * `billing` - an address used for correspondence purposes only

        A patient must have no more than one current `temp` and/or `billing` address.
        However, historically this was constrained only by the integration requirements and was not enforced so theoretically more than one can exist for a patient when retrieving.
        Where multiple instances already exist for the patient it is not expected that local systems should manage those, but should choose the most appropriate one to maintain (for example by examining period dates).

        A `home` address is the patient's main residential address and should normally be used for all clinical and demographic purposes, including clinical and appointment correspondence.
        However additionally, `temp` and `billing` addresses may be provided by a patient when there is a requirement to record an alternative location for the purposes of unbroken care.
        When sending correspondence to a patient:
        *	a present and valid `billing` address may take precedence over `home` and `temp` addresses. A patient should have only a single current `billing` address. An address is considered 'valid' according to its period start and to dates.
        *	if no current `billing` address is provided, a `temp` address may take precedence over the `home` address, again if it is valid according to its period start and to dates.
        * if there is no valid, current `billing` and/or `temp` address, the `home` address must be used.

        Not all local systems support `temp` and `billing` addresses, so these are not uniformly maintained. Therefore, where the patient contact has clinical or business significance, the precedence of these addresses over the `home` address should be determined by a user wherever possible.
        When the end date for a `temp` or `billing` address passes, local systems should use the patient’s `home` address. It is extremely rare that no home address is present on a patient record.

        Be aware of the following business rules:
        * you cannot add more than one of each address use types; `home`, `temp` or `billing`
        * `work` address `use` type is a valid response but cannot be added or replaced as it is a legacy value. An address with the `work` type can be removed though
        * any `temp` address must have both a `period start` and a `period end` date. The provision of a period end date has particular importance in order to avoid temporary addresses that are no longer relevant to the patient still being held as current data available to any system retrieving the patient record. A suggested default where no actual period end is known is 30 days later than the period start, up to a maximum of 3 months.
        * any `billing` address must have both a `period start` and a `period end` date. The provision of a period end date has particular importance in order to avoid correspondence addresses that are no longer relevant to the patient still being held as current data available to any system retrieving the patient record. A suggested default where no actual period end is known is 30 days later than the period start, up to a maximum of 12 months.
        * the date period is optional; where present they must be valid dates and the `end` date cannot be before the `start` date
        * the period `start` date is optional, however if provided cannot be a future date. If it is not provided it defaults to the date of update
        * where a `temp` address is provided a description must be sent using the `text` field, the list of possible values are:
          * `Second Home` - a patient's second home
          * `Student Accommodation` - a patient's place of residence while at university
          * `Respite Care Address` - where the patient resides during respite care
          * `Temporary Residence Address` - where the patient resides for a specific period of time
          * `Convalescence Home` - the address for a patient during a period of recovery
          * `Mobile Home` - the address of a patient's mobile home, parked for a specific period of time, e.g. the address of a caravan park
          * `Holiday Home` - the address for a patient during a holiday

        ### Communication

        Single item found under `extension` with the extension URL `https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-NHSCommunication`.

        In a JSON Patch request, where the communication extension does not exist the path should be:
        * `/extension/-` when adding a communication extension.

        Where you are replacing/removing the full communication extension, the path should be:
        * `/extension/0` if the communication extension is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path is `/extension/1`, and so on.

        Where the communication extension already exists and you wish to replace a specific sub-extension, then the path should be:
        * `/extension/0/extension/1` if the communication extension is the first item in the list and the sub-extension is the second item in the list.
        
        You can find examples of the above requests in our sandbox Postman collection

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * preferred language must not be supplied where it is English even though the [code list](https://simplifier.net/ukcore/codesystem-ukcore-humanlanguage) contains a value for English (en).
        * any language codes outside the accepted list are rejected; such as local system `qa` codes.

        ### Contact preferences
        Single item found under `extension` with the extension URL `https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-ContactPreference`.

        In a JSON Patch request, where the Contact Preference extension does not exist or you are replacing/removing the full list of Contact preferences, the path should be:
        * `/extension/0` if the contact preference is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path is `/extension/1`, and so on.
        * `/extension/-` when adding a contact preference.

        Where the Contact Preference extension already exists and you wish to add, replace or remove a specific contact preference(s) sub-extension, then the path should be:
        * `/extension/0/extension/1` if the contact preference extension is the first item in the list and the method is the second item in the sub-extension list.
        
        You can find examples of the above requests in our sandbox Postman collection 

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * a patient can have `0` or `1` contact preference.
        * preferred contact time is a free-text field limited to 40 characters.
        * where a contact time is specified a contact method must also exist.

        ### Date of birth

        Single item found under `birthDate` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be `/birthDate`.

        When adding or updating the birth date, the update should be in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * cannot be removed.
        * cannot be a date in the future.
        * cannot be after the deceased date, if present.

        ### Date of death

        Single item found under `deceasedDateTime` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be `/deceasedDateTime`.

        When adding or updating the deceased date time, the update should be in the format `yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM`.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * cannot be removed.
        * cannot be a date in the future.
        * cannot be before the birth date.
        * cannot be replaced if the death notification status is 2 (formal).
        * when adding date of death, a death notification status must also be added.

        ### Death notification

        Single item found under `extension` with the extension URL `https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-DeathNotificationStatus`.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/extension/0` if the death notification is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path is `/extension/1`, and so on.
        * `/extension/-` when adding a death notification.
        
        You can find examples of the above requests in our sandbox Postman collection

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * cannot be removed.
        * cannot be replaced if the death notification status is formal (2).
        * only certain endpoints can set a death notification of formal (2).
        * when adding a death notification, a deceased date time must also be added.

        ### Emergency contact

        List item found under `contact` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/contact/0` if the contact to be replaced or removed is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path is `/contact/1`, and so on.
        * `/contact/-` when adding a new contact.

        Only emergency contact details should be added to `contact`, regular telecommunication methods such as home phone should be added to the `telecom` field.
        Any other contact relationship types are rejected.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * in any telecom child object the `use` key should not be present.
        * in any telecom child object the system cannot be `fax`.
        * the date period is optional; where present they must be valid dates and the `end` date cannot be before the `start` date.
        * the period `start` date is optional, however if provided cannot be a future date. If it is not provided it defaults to the date of update.
        * the date period, if present, should be on the parent `contact` object and not any `telecom` child objects.
        * if the system is email, the value must be a valid email format, for example john.smith@nhs.net; and must be more than 6 characters and less than 90 characters
        * the relationship can only be `C` meaning `Emergency Contact`

        ### Gender

        Single item found under `gender` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be `/gender`.

        When setting a gender, the local system should encourage the user to select `male` or `female` rather than `unknown`.
        The fourth value of gender, `other`, meaning indeterminate; i.e. unable to be classified as either male or female; should never pro-actively be set by local systems - although this value can be retrieved due to legacy data or data quality issues.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
          * cannot be removed.
          * can only be `male`, `female` or `unknown`.
          * cannot set gender to `other`.

        ### General practice

        List item found under `generalPractitioner` field. Although only a single general practice is allowed.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/generalPractitioner/0` for replacing or removing the general practice.
        * `/generalPractitioner/-` when adding a new general practice.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * only valid GP Practice codes may be used, see [Organisation Data Service FHIR API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/) for more details on valid codes.
        * the period `start` date is optional, however if provided cannot be a future date. If it is not provided it defaults to the date of update.
        * do not provide a period `end` date.
        * the general practice should only be updated by primary care systems, [NHAIS](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhais) or by the National Back Office.
        * removal of a general practice can only be done by [NHAIS](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhais) or by the National Back Office.
        * only a single general practice is supported; emergency, temporary and additional practices must be maintained in the local system only.

        ### Multiple birth order

        Single item found under `multipleBirthInteger` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be `/multipleBirthInteger`.

        When adding or updating the birth order, the update should be an integer in the range `1` - `9` inclusive. These values have differing meanings:
        * 1 - 7 indicates the order of birth, with 1 indicating the first or only birth in the sequence, 2 indicating the second birth in the sequence, 3 indicating the third, and so on up to 7.
        * 8 - `Not applicable`
        * 9 - `Not known`

        ### Name

        List item found under `name` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/name/0` if the name to be replaced or removed is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path is `/name/1`, and so on.
        * `/name/-` when adding a new name.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * cannot add more than one `usual` name.
        * cannot remove the `usual` name.
        * cannot add more than one `nickname`.
        * can have multiple instances of all other name use types.
        * cannot replace the use type on an existing name. For example, once a name is a nickname, it cannot be changed directly to an alias. You must instead remove the nickname and add the alias.
        * the first character of each `suffix` item must be `A-Z`.
        * the date period is optional; where present they must be valid dates and the `end` date cannot be before the `start` date.
        * the period `start` date is optional, however if provided cannot be a future date. If it is not provided it defaults to the date of update.
        * supplied name data must be UTF-8 encodable.
        * the `period` is optional, but if included the `end` date cannot be before the `start` date. They can however be in the past, present or future.
        * the full available range of generally recognised titles are permitted, however, if any of the following are used then the value input must conform to the following format:
            * Mr
            * Mrs
            * Ms
            * Dr
            * Rev
            * Sir
            * Lady
            * Lord
        * any trailing full stops at the end of a prefix are automatically removed; for example `Mrs.` changes to `Mrs`.

        ### Pharmacy

        Single item found under `extension` with one of the extension urls:
        * `https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-NominatedPharmacy`
        * `https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-MedicalApplianceSupplier`
        * `https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-PreferredDispenserOrganization`

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/extension/0` if the pharmacy is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path is `/extension/1`, and so on
        * `/extension/-` when adding a pharmacy

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * multiple pharmacies are allowed, however only one of each type
        * there are no effective date periods, only a single current instance of each type is supported
        * only valid National Pharmacy codes may be used for the pharmacy identifier, see [Organisation Data Service FHIR API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/) for more details on valid codes

        ### Place of birth

        Single item found under `extension` with the extension URL `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-birthPlace`.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/extension/0` if the place of birth is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path is `/extension/1`, and so on
        * `/extension/-` when adding a place of birth

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * the three fields, `city`, `district` and `country` are all optional, however at least one of them must be provided
        * country is a coded value and must be in the set of valid values

        ### Telecom

        List item found under `telecom` field.

        In a JSON Patch request the path should be:
        * `/telecom/0` if the telecom to be replaced or removed is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path is `/telecom/1`, and so on
        * `/telecom/-` when adding a new telecom

        Emergency contact details should not be added to the `telecom` field, instead they should be added to the `contact` field.

        There are a number of business rules that should be taken into account:
        * the date period is optional; where present they must be valid dates and the `end` date cannot be before the `start` date
        * the period `start` date is optional, however if provided cannot be a future date. If it is not provided it defaults to the date of update.
        * if the telecom system is email, the value must be a valid email format, for example john.smith@nhs.net; and must be more than 6 characters and less than 90 characters

        ## Sandbox test scenarios

        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment.

        Things to note when using the sandbox for PATCH:
        * Your changes are not persisted.
        * JSON Patch operations themselves are validated, but the resulting resource is not validated for correctness; meaning any business rules are not applied.
        * You can use the patient with minimal data, `9000000033` to test adding all data types (as most of them are missing on this patient), that would normally be present (e.g. gender).

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to get a patient's related people details from PDS for a given NHS number. This is a list of people who can be contacted, and how, regarding the patient. These details may be useful for a practitioner to get in contact with a next of kin or guardian.
        
        ## Restricted patients
        Some patients are tagged as [restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/restricting-access-to-a-patients-demographic-record), or sensitive. Related people are not returned for a restricted patient and an empty bundle is returned.

        If a related person only contains a patient reference reference, and when the patient is retrieved, it is restricted; location sensitive fields such as `address` and `telecom` are removed.
